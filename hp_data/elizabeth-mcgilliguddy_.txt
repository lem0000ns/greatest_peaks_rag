"Mind you do."
--Elizabeth McGilliguddy, responding to the British Ministry of Magic's decision not to get involved in the American Revolution (Pm)
Elizabeth McGilliguddy was president of MACUSA during the American Revolution and the 1777 “Country or Kind?” debate. She encouraged the British Ministry of Magic to refrain from interfering in the war for American independence (Pm).
MACUSA moved its headquarters to Washington shortly before McGilliguddy's presidency (Pm).
Under McGilliguddy, MACUSA was officially uninvolved in the American Revolution, but members of the American wizarding community often did participate undercover to save No-Maj lives and to help defeat the British (Pm).
Elizabeth is a form of the Hebrew name "Elisheva," which either means "my God is an oath" or possibly "my God is abundance" (source: Behind the Name). One of this name's most famous bearers is Queen Elizabeth I of England; Elizabeth McGilliguddy's first name may be meant to signify strong female leadership.
The Irish Surname McGillicuddy derives from "McGillycuddy of the Reeks," an inherited title of Irish chiefs from the mountains now known as Macgillycuddy's Reeks (source: House of Names).
Actress Lucille Ball had the full name of "Lucille Esmeralda McGillicuddy Ricardo" on the "I Love Lucy" show in the 1950s-60s. The character, like Lucille Ball herself, grew up in Jamestown, New York (Source: Wikipedia - Lucy and Ricky Ricardo)
Macgillycuddy's Reeks in County Kerry, Ireland, is where Isolt Sayre was born and raised. -BB
