First Introduced GF1: The Riddle House

Resident of Little Hangleton, who remembered Frank Bryce as a child, who (when the rumor began spreading that he was responsible for the Riddles’ deaths), was quick to say that she thought he had a horrible temper, and to support her opinion with childhood reminiscences. When Frank was released after questioning, she maintained that “if he had any decency, he’d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it” (GF1).
