Profession Quidditch player (Seeker)
First Introduced Pm: Pottermore

Shanice Higgins played Seeker for the Jamaican National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
During the Quidditch World Cup in 2014, her team lost to the United States, following the collapse of her Keeper from an infected team mascot bite sustained during the opening ceremony (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Higgins must have been born after 1976.
Shanice may be a variant of the girl's name Janice, which is of Hebrew origin and means "Yahweh is gracious, Yahweh is merciful" (Baby Namespedia).
Higgins may come from English name Hugh "mind, spirit" or Irish Gaelic family name Ó hUiginn (O'Higgins) (Wikipedia). The similar Jamaican word higgler is an old English word for a market trader (World Wide Words).
