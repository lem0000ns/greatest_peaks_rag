First Introduced OP21: The Eye of the Snake

Jack Sloper was a Gryffindor Hogwarts student. HeÂ played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as a replacement Beater when Fred and George were banned from playing (OP21). He was a poor substitute, so bad at handling his bat that he hit Angelina Johnson in the mouth with it during a match and even managed to knock himself unconscious during a team practice.
Jack was at least a second-year and definitely not a fifth-year when he was a stand-in Beater on the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
