Quidditch Teams of Europe
The Quidditch Teams of Europe are well-established. The broom game of Quidditch quickly spread from its origins on Queerditch Marsh to Europe, with evidence of games played in Ireland and Norway in the late fourteenth century.
The tournament of European Quidditch-playing nations is called the “European Cup“.
The first Quidditch World Cup in 1473 featured all-European sides. European teams were the only participants in the Quidditch World Cup tournaments throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
