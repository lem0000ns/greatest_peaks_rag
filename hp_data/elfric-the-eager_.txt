Elfric the Eager was a leader of an historical uprising (PS16).
After sitting her first-year History of Magic exam, Hermione Granger mentioned that it did not cover "the uprising of Elfric the Eager" (PS16).
Elfric the Eager and his uprising are only mentioned in passing, but it is likely that he was a Goblin and the leader of a Goblin rebellion.
