Torquil MacTavish was a Scottish wizard who participated in a broom race that led to the destruction of the Colosseum. MacTavish and his Italian rival Silvio Astolfi flew a close race from Aberdeen to Rome. In the explosions at the end of the race that destroyed the Colosseum, MacTavish was hit with a hex that turned his kneecaps backwards. It was not known who won the race (BoS).
