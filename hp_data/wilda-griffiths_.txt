"Chaser Griffiths, lured from the Holyhead Harpies for a 1000 Galleon fee, was responsible for no fewer than nine of United's ten goals."
-- match report in the Daily Prophet (DP2)
Wilda Griffiths was a Chaser for the Puddlemere United Quidditch team during the 1990s.
Considered to be an outstanding Chaser, Griffiths was lured away from the Holyhead Harpies by a huge fee, much to the chagrin of their talented but dangerous captain Gwenog Jones. She was also said to be untroubled by death threats made by Ms Jones (DP2).

The Daily Prophet reported that Harpies’ captain Jones referred to Griffiths as “lower than rat droppings” and was looking forward to playing against Wilda and the Puddlemere United team (DP3).
Jones was heard to mention in passing that Griffiths “deserved to be gnawed to death by a starving tarantula”. However, the following week during a match between Puddlemere and the Harpies, Griffiths mysteriously disappeared from her broom mid-match (DP4).
Wilda is of English origin and means "wild, untamed" (BabyNamesPedia).
Griffiths is a Welsh surname which can mean "son of the strong leader" (Wikipedia) or "son of the griffin/dragon".
Could Gwenog Jones be responsible for Wilda's disappearance, or was the timing a mere coincidence? Following the disturbances during the match, Ms Jones was said to be "helping the Ministry with its enquiries".
Although the dates printed on the Daily Prophet Newsletters are:
the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
