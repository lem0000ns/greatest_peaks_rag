First Introduced QA9: The Development of the Racing Broom

The Spudmore family is famous for its association with the sport broom industry. The two known members of this family, Able and and his son Randolph, are broom designers. Able Spudmoreâ€™s company, Ellerby and Spudmore, was located in the Black Forest in Germany in the 1940s and 50s, which may indicate that the family has roots there.
