'And look, Broderick, you've been sent a pot plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy Hippogriff for each month; they'll brighten things up, won't they?'
-- Miriam Strout to her patient just before the plant strangled him (OP23)
Miriam Strout was the Healer in charge of the Janus Thickey ward (a closed, longterm ward for patients with permanent spell damage) at St. Mungo’s Hospital at the time of Broderick Bode’s assassination (OP23, 25). She was quite chatty and was “motherly-looking.” She treated Lockhart (a resident in the same ward) affectionately, but like a child. Other charges in her care were Agnes, a woman whose entire head was covered with fur (she also barked), and Alice and Frank Longbottom.
Healer on the Fifth Floor of St. Mungo's Hospital (OP22, OP25).
