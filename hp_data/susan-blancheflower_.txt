Profession Quidditch player (Keeper)
First Introduced QWC: The Quidditch World Cup (essays)

"Their primary weakness is in defence. Keeper Susan Blancheflower let 23 Jamaican goals past her in the first round."
-- Ludo Bagman's thoughts before the semi-final rounds of the 2014 Quidditch World Cup (QWC)
Susan Blancheflower played Keeper for the United States National Team at the Quidditch World Cup in 2014.
A participant in the 2014 tournament, her weakness in the early rounds was letting in too many goals during the opening matches against Jamaica and their subsequent quarter-final against Liechtenstein (QWC).
Hit in the face by a Bludger coming from one of her own teammates in a two-day match against Brazilian National Team and letting in goals due to her own errors, her team lost by 420 points to 310 (QWC).
They also lost in the third place play-off against Japan. On this occasion, Blancheflower let in 18 goals. However, in spite of the loss, fourth overall was still considered to be a good result for the Americans (QWC).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (QWC), Blancheflower must have been born after 1976.
Susan, a diminutive of Susanna, comes from the Hebrew name שׁוֹשַׁנָּה (Shoshannah) meaning "lily" (Behind the Name).
Blancheflower means "white/fair flower".
As she comes from the United States, Blancheflower may possibly have attended the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
