"Yet more controversy in Patagonia: the outcome of the USA versus Jamaica clash is under investigation due to the sudden collapse of Kquewanda Bailey...."
-- Ginny Weasley reporting for the Daily Prophet, 16 May 2014 (QWC)
Kquewanda Bailey played Keeper for Jamaica’s National Team at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014.
During their first fixture in the 2014 tournament, Bailey suddenly collapsed and toppled from her broom at a crucial point in Jamaica’s match against the USA, but was saved by the referee’s quick thinking use of “arresto momentum“. Following an inquiry, it turned out Bailey had been bitten by a Sasabonsam during the opening ceremonies, and the bite had become infected (QWC).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (QWC), Bailey must have been born after 1976.
Bailey is a surname derived from Middle English baili meaning "bailiff" (Behind the Name) and the surname Bailey is borne by 1 out of 199 people in Jamaica (Forbears). Aleen Bailey, a Jamaican sprinter, won a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics (Wikipedia).
