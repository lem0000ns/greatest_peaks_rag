Moors
A moor is a broad tract of open land, often high but poorly drained, with patches of heath and peat bogs. Of the heather moorland in the United Kingdom, most of it lies in North Yorkshire, Wales, Cumbria, and Dartmoor (with some moorlands in the far West Country in the county of Cornwall). Godric Gryffindor hailed from “wild moor” according to the Sorting Hat, and could accordingly have been from the any of these regions (GF12).
Because they are sparsely populated, desolate areas of English moorland are often used for Quidditch matches. Some of the moors used for this include Dartmoor (the location of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup) and Exmoor, both in the West Country (DP, Pm, GF4).
