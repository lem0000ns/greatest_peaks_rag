First Introduced BFT: The Black Family Tree

Ignatius Prewett was the husband of Lucretia Black and a paternal uncle of Sirius Black (BFT) .
Since Molly Prewett Weasley and Sirius are "cousins by marriage," Ignatius must be closely related to the father of Molly, Gideon, and Fabian Prewett. Ignatius and Lucretia were childless (BFT and my notes).
