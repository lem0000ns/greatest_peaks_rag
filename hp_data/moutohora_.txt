Moutohora
Moutohora is home of the Moutohora Macaws, New Zealandâ€™s most famous professional Quidditch team (QA8).
Moutohora in New Zealand is a tiny island (also called "Whale Island") off the coast of Whakatane in the Bay of Plenty in Northern New Zealand (Wikipedia). Over the past century have been several failed money-making attempts based off the island; today the entire island is a wildlife refuge with restricted access (though apparently wizards still live there anyway!)
