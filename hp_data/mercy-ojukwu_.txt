"....a veritable master class of Bludger work"
-- match report by Ginny Weasley, 10 June 2014, Daily Prophet (Pm)
Mercy Ojukwu was a Beater for the Nigerian National Team at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014 (Pm).
Ojukwu was a member of the Nigerian team at the 2014 tournament. She and the other Nigerian Chaser, Aliko Okoye, were “ferocious” against the Fijians in their first match, winning by 400 points to 160 (Pm).
Prior to the tournament, the Nigeria National Team was considered to be one of the favourites to win in 2014. In spite of an artistic display of ability – by both sets of Beaters – they lost their quarter-final match against the Japanese National Team (270-100), due to the disintegration of their Seeker’s Thunderbolt VII during the match (Pm).
Hitting a Bludger in an artistic, creative and precise manner
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Ojukwu must have been born after 1976.
Mercy means "compassion, forgiveness, pity" and derives from the Latin "merces" (payment, reward) (Babyname Wizard).
Two famous Nigerian actors are named Mercy: Mercy Aigbe Gentry and Mercy Johnson Okojie.
Odumegwu Ojukwu, a Nigerian general, was the President of Biafra from May 1967 to January 1970 (Wikipedia).
