Profession Quidditch player (Chaser)
First Introduced Pm: Pottermore

Stoyanka Grozda was a Chaser on the Bulgarian National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
Chaser Grozda was a member of the Bulgarian side at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup (Pm).
She and fellow Chasers Bogomil Levski and Nikola Vassileva were considered "less flashy" than those on the other teams participating at the tournament. However, they did win all three of their matches against New Zealand, Norway and Japan to get to the final (Pm).
Although the Bulgarian Chasers only scored two goals against a talented Brazilian side - and a Quaffle drop by Grozda led to one of the Brazil goals, Viktor Krum's capture of the Snitch meant that Bulgaria were the overall winners of the tournament (Pm).
Since her teammate Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Grozda must have been born after 1976.
Stoyanka (Bulgarian: Стоянка) is the feminine form of Stoyan, from стоя (stoya) "to stand, to stay" (Behind the Name).
Grozda (Bulgarian: Грозда) is the feminine form of Grozdan, from грозде (grozde) "grapes" (Behind the Name).
