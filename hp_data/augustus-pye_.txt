First Introduced OP22: St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries

Trainee Healer on the Dai Llewellyn Ward of St. Mungo’s who tried to heal Arthur Weasley’s snakebite in December 1995. He was very interested in “complementary medicine” (using Muggle techniques along with the magical approaches). He and Arthur decided to give stitches a try, but something in the wound kept dissolving them, so they didn’t work (OP23). Molly was not impressed.
