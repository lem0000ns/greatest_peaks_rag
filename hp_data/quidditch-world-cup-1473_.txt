"There were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473."
-- from the Hogwarts library book "Quidditch Through the Ages" (PS11)
The Quidditch World Cup 1473 was the first Quidditch World Cup game to be played. It has gone down in history as one of the most violent of all time, as it involved every one of the 700 ways to commit a Quidditch foul. The final match pitted Transylvania against Flanders (QA6, QWC).
Quidditch World Cup tournaments take place over several months, with the final match falling in July (as in 2014, QWC) or August (as in 1994, GF8). However, the first World Cup matches may very well not have followed this modern schedule.

The full list of the 700 fouls from this match will never be published, as the Department of Magical Games and Sports does not want people to get ideas.... (QA6)
