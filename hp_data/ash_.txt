Ash
"Those witches and wizards best suited to ash wands are not, in my experience, lightly swayed from their beliefs or purposes."
-- Mr. Ollivander (Pm)
"** THE FIREBOLT **
THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART PACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM-LINED, SUPERFINE HANDLE OF ASH ..."

A wand wood also used to make other magical objects.
Some time after I had given Harry his holly-and-phoenix wand I came across a description of how the Celts had assigned trees to different parts of the year and discovered that, entirely by coincidence, I had assigned Harry the ‘correct’ wood for his day of birth. I therefore decided to give Ron and Hermione Celtic wand woods, too. Ron, who was born in the February 18 - March 17 period, was given an ash wand (I think I had originally marked him down for beech), and Hermione, who was born between September 2 and September 29, received a vine wood wand (I can’t remember what I originally stipulated for Hermione; possibly I had not specified a wood for her at that stage) (JKR).
Inconsistency: While the Firebolt is advertised with a handle made of ash in PA, on Pottermore it is described as having a handle of ebony wood. (Pm)

Ash trees are associated with lightning and the old English saying "Ash Courts Flash." Perhaps that was the inspiration for the Firebolt made with an ash handle. source: English Gardening
