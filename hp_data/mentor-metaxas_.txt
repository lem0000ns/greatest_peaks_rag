"The VIP boxes are now full. Chairman of the ICWQC, Mentor Metaxas, chats to the President of the Argentinian Council of Magic, Valentina Vazquez...."
-- Rita Skeeter reporting from the 2014 Quidditch World Cup final (Pm)
Mentor Metaxas was Chairman of the International Confederation of Wizards Quidditch Committee (ICWQC) in 2014 (Pm).
Rita Skeeter reported that Metaxas was a VIP guest at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup final (Pm).
Mentor is a Greek name deriving from μενος (menos) meaning "mind, purpose, strength, courage". In Greek legend Mentor was the son of Alkimos and associate of Odysseus (Behind the Name).
Metaxas is a Greek name (Metaxās or Metaxa) meaning "silk grower or trader" (Wikipedia). Several famous Greek people have the surname Metaxas, including the dictator, general and Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas.
With such a Greek name, it is likely that Chairman Metaxas is either from Greece or of Greek ancestry. With the famous Harry Potter, friends and family in the VIP Box 2, the crowd attending the final match probably haven't even noticed the other VIP guests....
