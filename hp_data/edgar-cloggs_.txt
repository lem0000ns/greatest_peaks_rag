First Introduced Games

Edgar Cloggs is a ghost who has been hanging around the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch as long as anyone can remember. Edgar was obviously a pretty good player in his day (Games).
Cloggs appears on a Famous Wizard card in the "Prisoner of Azkaban" video game. While the video games aren't usually considered canon, J K Rowling has said that these cards were. Cloggs alsoÂ shows up in the "Quidditch World Cup" video game.
An essay by Lexicon editor ibid discusses why Edgar Cloggs and other video game FW cards are not canon: "Famous Wizards: Analysis and Discussion"
