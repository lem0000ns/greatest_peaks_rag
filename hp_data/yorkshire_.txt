Yorkshire

Yorkshire is a large, well-known county in northeastern England.
Perhaps its biggest contribution to Harry's life is the frequent Hogwarts dish of Yorkshire pudding, though we also hear of the county when Muggles phone in to report shooting stars here in PS1 as wizards celebrated Voldemort's downfall.
Yorkshire was the residence of Goodwin Kneen, a wizard who, thanks to a letter to his cousin, is responsible for one of our earliest records of a Quidditch match (QA3).
There is also a Quidditch stadium on a Yorkshire moor (more...)
