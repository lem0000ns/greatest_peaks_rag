goat
“Stag? ... It’s a goat, idiot!”
-- Aberforth Dumbledore on his Patronus (DH28)
Non-magical farm animal with surprising uses. Goats are one of the oldest domesticated animals and are raised all over the world for their milk, meat, hair and skin.
 
The bezoar, which is an antidote to most poisons, comes from the stomach of a goat (PS8, HBP18). 
Aberforth Dumbledore is particularly fond of goats. He was once prosecuted for practising inappropriate charms on a goat (GF24), the Hogs Head smells of goats (OP16), and his patronus is a goat (DH28).
Goats are a popular food source for dragons and giants (FB, OP20)
Grumble the Grubby Goat is the title of one of Beedle the Bard's tales. It was Aberforth's favourite story (TBB)
The chimaera has the body of a goat (FB).
