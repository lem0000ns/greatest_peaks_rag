Blatching
Blatching is the Quidditch foul of flying to intentionally collide with another player (QA6).
It will have been one of the fouls committed at the first Quidditch World Cup in 1473, where an instance of every known foul occurred (QA6).
During their Round of 16 match in the Quidditch World Cup of 2014, a New Zealand Chaser, Dennis Moon, was sent off in the 106th minute after the Referee ruled that he had deliberately collided with Bogomil Levski, one of the Bulgarian National Team’s Chasers (QWC).
