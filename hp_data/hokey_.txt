First Introduced HBP20: Lord Voldemort’s Request

"Lovely, madam," squeaked Hokey. - Hokey (HBP20)
A house-elf who was bound to serve Hepzibah Smith, and was quite elderly when Tom Marvolo Riddle was a young man. He framed her for accidentally causing the death of Hepzibah Smith by poisoning the woman’s cocoa. To ensure her conviction, Riddle even modified Hokey’s memory so that she would confess (HBP20).
Harry's thoughts on Hokey: "Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey's contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion." - HBP20
Bias against house-elves contributed to the Ministry's willingness to suspect Hokey (HBP20).
According to merriam-webster.com, "hokey" can mean "very silly, old-fashioned, or sentimental," which certainly describes Hokey's mistress, Hepzibah Smith.
