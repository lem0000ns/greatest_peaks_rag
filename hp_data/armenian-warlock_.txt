Armenian warlock


					Armenian warlock
			
Gender Male Species / Race Wizard
First Introduced CS16: The Chamber of Secrets

Described as “ugly” and “old” by Gilderoy Lockhart, this warlock was the one who faced the Wagga Wagga Werewolf – only to have his memory wiped by Lockhart, who took credit for the warlock’s heroism by writing about it in Wandering with Werewolves (CS16).
If Lockhart's descriptions of his actions are true, though misattributed, this warlock was able to perform the "immensely complex" Homorphus Charm (CS10).
