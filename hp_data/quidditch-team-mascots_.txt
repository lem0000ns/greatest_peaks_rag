Quidditch Team Mascots
"A display from the team mascots will precede the match."
"Oh that's always worth watching. National teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show."
-- Hermione Granger and Mr Weasley (GF8)
"A magnificent exhibition of the diversity of the magizoological world"
-- description of the mascot-themed opening ceremony of the 2014 Quidditch World Cup - before the bloodbath (Pm)
Quidditch team mascots are a traditional part of the game of Quidditch.
At Quidditch World Cup tournaments, team mascots put on a display prior to the final match (GF8, Pm). An attempt to have a display of mascots from all the participants at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup resulted in a disastrous bloodbath (Pm).
The competition between teams to bring exciting and/or dangerous mascots is intense. In 1995, the ICWQC put forward a motion to restrict the size and address safety concerns about mascots. However, this was defeated by a huge majority. No Quidditch supporters worldwide wanted this traditional part of the game to be altered (Pm).
Known team mascots:
The Hogwarts School team mascots are the badger (Hufflepuff), the lion (Gryffindor), the eagle (Ravenclaw) and the snake (Slytherin).
