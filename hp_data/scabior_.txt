Profession Snatcher
First Introduced DH23: Malfoy Manor

Scabior was a member of the group of Snatchers who captured Harry, Ron, and Hermione (DH23).
Thinking the name "Dudley" sounded familiar, Scabior himself fell for the assertion that Harry Potter was actually a Slytherin named Vernon Dudley whose father worked at the Ministry. However, it was also Scabior who found Harry's glasses and thus led Fenrir Greyback to suspect the boy's true identity (DH23).
Scabior was eventually stunned during the capture of Harry, Ron, and Hermione (DH23).
