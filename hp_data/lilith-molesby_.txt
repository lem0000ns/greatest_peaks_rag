First Introduced DP3: Daily Prophet Issue 3

"....told friends of mine he would rather be beaten to death by trolls than take me out for dinner."
-- Lilith Molesby (DP3)
Witch whose letter was published on the Problem Page of the Daily Prophet (DP3)
Lilith Molesby's letter asked how to get a very reluctant wizard to fall in love and settle down. She queried whether a Love Potion would work. She is advised by emotional dilemmas expert Grizel Hurtz that it would be better for Ms Molesby to embark on a course of Hate Potions rather than "constantly having to doctor your partner’s drinks" (DP3)
While the date printed on DP3 is 1 June 1999, the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
