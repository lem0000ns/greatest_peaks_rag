Alguff the Awful was afoul-smelling goblin nuisance. Well known throughout the goblin world for trying to sell vials of his sweat to a Dungbomb manufacturer (FW).
We are not given any dates for Alguff's life. However, since he is known to have sold his sweat to a dungbomb manufacturer, and since dungbombs weren't invented until sometime in the 1800s, we can safely say that he lived in the 19th or 20th centuries.
