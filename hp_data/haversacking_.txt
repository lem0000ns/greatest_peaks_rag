Haversacking
A Quidditch foul where the Quaffle goes through the goal hoop before it is released from the Chaser’s hand (it must be thrown to score) (QA6).
This would also have been one of the 700 fouls committed during the 1473 Quidditch World Cup (QA6).
A "haversack" is an English word for a rucksack (UK) or backpack (US) and used to carry food or possessions. The Chaser is putting the Quaffle into the goal as if it was a sack when committing this foul.
