Zograf played Keeper for the Bulgarian National Team at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.
The team lost to the Irish team in the final match of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup. Zograf was penalised for the foul of cobbing when Irish Chaser Moran was attempting to score (GF8).

The 1994 tournament was overshadowed by the chaos in the campground and appearance of the Dark Mark after the match (GF9, Pm).
Zograf may be a reference to the Zograf Monastery, a Bulgarian monastery on Mount Athos in Greece. The monastery contains the icon of Saint George the Zograf and also the Zograf Codex, a Gospel which comes from there (Wikipedia).
