First Introduced GF27: Padfoot Returns

"Rosier and Wilkes - they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell."
-- Sirius Black (GF27)
Wilkes was a Death Eater during the first war with Voldemort, and was killed around the same time as Death Eater Evan Rosier, according to Sirius Black (GF27).
Wilkes was possibly killed during the same fight in which Rosier blew off part of Mad Eye Moodyâ€™s nose (GF30).
