Flying Carpet
"Oh and I've been wanting a word with you too, Arthur," said Mr. Crouch, his sharp eyes falling upon Mr. Weasley.  "Ali Bashir's on the warpath.  He wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets."
Mr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh.
"I sent him an owl about that just last week.  If I've told him once I've told him a hundred times: Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen?"
"I doubt it," said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from Percy.  "He's desperate to export here."
"Well, they'll never replace brooms in Britain, will they?" said Bagman.
"Ali thinks there's a niche in the market for a family vehicle," said Mr. Crouch.  "I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve--but that was before carpets were banned, of course."

Flying carpets rather than brooms are the standard magical means of transportation in Asia and the Middle East (QA7). Flying carpets were once legal in Britain, but have been illegal for years since they are now on the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects. In other words, carpets are now defined in Britain as a Muggle artifact that it is illegal to enchant, so it is not lawful to import them (GF7)
