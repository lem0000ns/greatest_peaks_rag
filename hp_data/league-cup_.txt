League Cup
The League Cup is won by the professional Quidditch team at the top of the British and Irish Quidditch League.
The criteria for winning the Cup is being the team that has accumulated the most points at the end of the season (QA7).
The League Table published in the Daily Prophet shows the position of the teams following the previous day’s matches. The team with the least points – either daily or at the end of the season – is said to be sitting at the “Bottom-of-the-Table” (DP1, DP2, DP3, DP4).
Technically, it should be called by its full name of the "British and Irish League Cup". It may also be referred to as the "British League Cup". The shorter form is preferred.
Although the dates printed on the Daily Prophet Newsletters are:
the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
