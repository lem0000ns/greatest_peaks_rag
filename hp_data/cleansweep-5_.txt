"You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them."
-- Draco Malfoy (CS7)
The Cleansweep Five broom (QA9) was produced by the Cleansweep Broom Company, probably sometime in the 1950s, as the Holyhead Harpies‘ captain had one by 1953 (QA7).
The Weasley twins, Fred and George, fly Cleansweep Fives while playing on the Gryffindor Quidditch team (CS7) and they escape from Hogwarts on them during their seventh year (OP28, OP29, OP30).
Gwendolyn Morgan, the Captain of the Holyhead Harpies team in 1953, flew with a Cleansweep Five broom, using it during a famous match against the Heidelberg Harriers to bring their captain to his senses (QA7).
