Harry saw her as a "druidess" who was scratching her nose when he collected her Chocolate Frog Card during his first trip on the Hogwarts Express (PS6).
From clodhna meaning “shapely.” Pronounced "CLEEV-nah"
In Irish mythology, Cliodna is a goddess of beauty. She is associated with the Irish tale of the Blarney Stone. She told the owner of Blarney Castle to kiss a stone in the morning before he went to court to plead a case, and his words gained eloquence and favor. The man was so impressed he built the stone into a tower of the castle. To this day people visit the castle and "kiss the Blarney Stone" to give them the gift of gab and the ability to flatter others.
