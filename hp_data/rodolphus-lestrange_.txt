Rodolphus Lestrange was a Slytherin student in the early 1970s (GF27) and a Death Eater thereafter. He was the brother of Rabastan, husband of Bellatrix (GF27, GF30, OP6). Rodolphus and his brother Rabastan were captured by the Ministry of Magic after their attack on the Longbottoms (November or December 1981) and given a life sentence in Azkaban (GF27, GF33); however, they escaped when the Dementors turned against the Ministry in January 1996 (OP25) .
Rodolphus was apparently returned to Azkaban at some point. Then, at a later date, he either escaped a second time or was released (CC4.11).
Soon after leaving Azkaban a second time, Rodolphus told Delphi about the prophecy concerning her and informed her that she was the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix (CC4.11).
