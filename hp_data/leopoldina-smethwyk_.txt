Gender Female Birth 1829
Death 1910
Species / Race Witch
Profession Quidditch referee
First Introduced FW: The Famous Wizard Cards

Leopoldina Smethwyk was the first witch to referee a Quidditch match (FW).
Leopoldina is the female form of the male given name Leopold, which derives from the Germanic leud "people" plus bald "bold". It was later altered to reflect the association with the Latin word leo ("lion") (Behind the Name).
Smethwyk could be related to the town of Smethwick near Birmingham in the West Midlands (Wikipedia).
The similarity of names and the year of her birth suggest that Leopoldina may be the daughter of Elliot Smethwyck, who created the cushioning charm in 1820.
