The Sacred Twenty-Eight



The Ollivanders are a famous wizarding family of wandmakers whose wands have been sold since Roman times. They are one of the so-called ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight’ families listed in the Pure-Blood Directory of the early 1930s.
Notable Members of this family include:
Gervaise Ollivander
Geraint Ollivander
Gerbold Octavius Ollivander
Garrick Ollivander
 
The name "Ollivander" means "he who owns the olive wand", suggesting that the original Ollivander was from somewhere in the Mediterranean (Pm).
