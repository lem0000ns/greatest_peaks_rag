Langdon Shaw was the younger son of newspaper magnate Henry Shaw Sr. Langdon was an excitable young man with a proclivity for wild ideas. He was frustrated by living in his elder brother’s shadow (WFT).
Langdon believed the Barebones about the existence of witches, and wanted his father's paper to run a story attributing the recent destruction in the city to witchcraft. Langdon appears to have had a tendency to drink too much. When his elder brother is killed by an obscurial, Langdon's reaction was excitement about evidence of witches. Along with his father and newspaper staff, Langdon witnessed the final destructive episode of Credence Barebone's obscurial (WFT).
Excited to try to show he has authority/power
