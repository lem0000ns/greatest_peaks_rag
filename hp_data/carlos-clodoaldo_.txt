"Clodoaldo drove him off course."
-- match report for USA v Brazil, Daily Prophet, 5 July 2014 (Pm)
Carlos Clodoaldo is a Beater for Brazil’s National Team in at the Quidditch World Cup in 2014.
A participant in the 2014 tournament alongside fellow Beater Rafael Santos, Clodoaldo helped secure Brazil’s victory in their hard-fought two day semi-final against the Americans with a “precision-hit Bludger” directed at Seeker Darius Smackhammer (Pm).
In their earlier matches at the tournament, his team won their initial match against a team from Haiti and a tense quarter-final match against the Welsh National Team. The Brazilian team ultimately lost to Bulgaria in the final by 170 points to 60 (Pm).
Precision aim
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Clodoaldo must have been born after 1976.
Carlos, the Spanish form of the names Charles and Karl, means "manly" (Behind the Name).
Clodoaldo is the name of a famous Brazilian footballer (Clodoaldo Tavares de Santana), who played for the Brazil National Team as a defensive midfielder between 1969 and 1974 (Wikipedia).
As he comes from Brazil, Clodoaldo may have attended the Castelobruxo Wizarding School.
