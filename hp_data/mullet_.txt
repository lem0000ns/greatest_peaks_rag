First Introduced GF8: The Quidditch World Cup

"Theeeeeeeey’re OFF! And it’s Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!"
-- match commentary, Bulgaria v Ireland final, 1994 Quidditch World Cup (GF8)
Mullet was a Chaser and member of the Irish National Team at the Quidditch World Cup in 1994.
Riding the recently released Firebolt brooms, the Irish side played and won against Bulgaria in the final match of the tournament. The other members of the team were Chasers Moran and Troy, Beaters Connolly and Quigley, Keeper Barry Ryan and Seeker Aidan Lynch. Mullet scored a penalty after the Bulgarian keeper committed the foul of cobbing as she approached the goal (GF8).
The 1994 tournament was the international debut of Bulgarian Seeker Viktor Krum and was marred by the reappearance of the Dark Mark and the events in the campground following the final match (GF9, QWC).
The word mullet has three meanings in English: (1) a type of edible marine fish; (2) a heraldic star used for a third son; and (3) a male hairstyle popular in the 1990s (Oxford English Dictionary).

Like the other members of the Irish National Team, Mullet is named for one of J.K. Rowling's friends:
"The Irish Quidditch team players are all named after people I have known." (JKR)
