Abel Treetops was a wizard from Cincinnati who said in 1832 that he had a patented approach for taming Wampus Cats so that they might be used as guards for wizarding homes. In actuality, Treetops was placing Engorgement Charms on Kneazles, which are tame and naturally hostile to suspicious and threatening people. This fraud was discovered and exposed when MACUSA raided Treetopsâ€™s home (FB).
