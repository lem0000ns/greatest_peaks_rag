Hunter
Hunter is an archaic Quidditch term for the equivalent player to the modern Seeker (QA4).
This term was in use from the mid-1200s, when Quidditch was still the game of “Cuaditch” (QA4).
These players were called Hunters because their only task in the match was to capture (and therefore likely kill) a beautiful little bird known as the “Golden Snidget“. Such was the popularity of the introduction of Hunters and Snidgets to the game, the bird became an endangered species (QA4).
