"We will arrest you and you will probably find yourself in Azkaban"
-- Dempster Wiggleswade (DP3)
Dempster Wiggleswade was an employee of the Ministry of Magic in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and one of a team of experts answering reader questions for the Daily Prophet‘s problem page (DP3)
Wigglewade specialised in legal problems. He advised a feuding wizard that it would be illegal to transfigure his brother's children as an act of revenge (DP3)
The "Office for the Removal of Curses, Jinxes and Hexes" does not exist in the later books. It may have become part of the "Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes".
While the date printed on DP3 is 1 June 1999, the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
