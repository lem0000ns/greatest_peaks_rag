QWC: The Quidditch World Cup (essays)

 Type of Event Wizarding world 
The Quidditch World Cup 2002 final match was played between Egypt and Bulgaria. After the Seeker Rawya Zaghloul caught the Snitch (Egypt won by 450 points to Bulgaria’s 300), defeated Bulgarian Seeker Viktor Krum announced his retirement from international Quidditch (QWC).
Quidditch World Cup tournaments take place over several months, with the final match falling in July (as in 2014, QWC) or August (as in 1994, GF8).
Viktor Krum is nothing if not persistent. He appears again at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014 (QWC).
