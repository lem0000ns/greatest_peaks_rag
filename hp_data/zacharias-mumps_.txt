First Introduced QA5: Anti-Muggle Precautions

"As Zacharias Mumps so rightly suggested six hundred years ago, Quidditch pitches are safest on deserted moors."
-- extract from Quidditch Through the Ages (QA5)
Zacharias Mumps wrote a description of Quidditch in 1398 which closely matches the current form of the game (QA5).
Mumps emphasised the need for finding a place to play Quidditch that was secure from the notice of Muggles (QA5). He also described the duties and titles of the players, the balls and the shape of the pitch (QA6).
Zacharius derives from the Hebrew name זְכַרְיָה (Zekharyah) meaning "Yahweh remembers" (Behind the Name).
Mumps is a contagious childhood disease (Wikipedia).
