Norfolk
Norfolk is a seaside county in east-central England and is full of fens, which makes it a possible home for Salazar Slytherin. It was the home of Cyprian Youdle, a Quidditch referee who was killed during a match in 1357 due to a curse from the crowd – the most recent such death on record (QA6).
Cormac McLaggen went nogtail hunting in Norfolk with his Uncle Tiberius, Bertie Higgs, and Rufus Scrimgeour (HBP7).
When Ron and Harry flew Arthur Weasley’s car to Hogwarts, they were spotted over Norfolk by a Muggle, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss (CS5) – interesting since Norfolk is not particularly close to the path from London to Hogwarts.
