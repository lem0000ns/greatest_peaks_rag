"Kristoffersen not only neglected to mark him, but was actually looking the other way when Krum raised his right hand to show that he had secured a Bulgarian victory in the 42nd minute."
-- match report Bulgaria v Norway, Daily Prophet, 6 June 2014 (Pm)
Sigrid Kristofferson played Seeker for the Norwegian National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
A member of one of the "favourite" teams to win the Quidditch World Cup 2014 tournament, Kristoffersen caught the Snitch in their match against the Ivory Coast, but failed to triumph over Viktor Krum in the quarter-final match against Bulgaria (she was looking the other way when he caught it). She did not take the defeat gracefully, banging her head against the floor until pulled away by a teammate (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Kristoffersen must have been born after 1976.
Sigrid comes from the Old Norse name Sigríðr, which was derived from the elements sigr "victory" and fríðr "beautiful, fair" (Behind the Name).
Kristoffersen is a Scandinavian surname meaning "son of Christopher". The name Christopher derives from the Greek Χριστοφορος (Christophoros) meaning "bearing Christ" (from Χριστος (Christos) and φερω (phero) "to bear, to carry") (Behind the Name).
