First Introduced HBP11: Hermioneâ€™s Helping Hand

Melinda Bobbin was a Hogwarts student, who in 1996 was chosen as a member of the Slug Club because her family owned a large chain of apothecaries (HBP7).
Slughorn described her as "charming" (HBP7).
A bobbin is a spool around which thread or yard is wound, but "bobbins" is also a British slang word meaning "bad," "wrong," or "worthless" (source: Wikipedia).
