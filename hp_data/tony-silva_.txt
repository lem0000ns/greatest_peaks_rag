"Silva.... performed a spectacular dive in the 131st minute of the match to seize victory"
-- match report Brazil v Wales, Daily Prophet, 4 June 2014 (Pm)
Tony Silva played Seeker for Brazil’s National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
A participant in the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014, Silva acquitted himself best in the quarter-final against Wales, where he caught the Snitch in a "spectacular dive." He also caught the Snitch in the semi-final against the USA, but that was largely due to the Brazilian Beaters impeding the American Seeker with a pair of Bludgers (Pm).
Silva put up a good fight, but ended up losing after a brilliant Snitch capture by Viktor Krum of Bulgaria in the finals. In a display of sportsmanship, the two Seekers embraced at the conclusion of the match (Pm).
Spectacular dives
Silva didn't have to catch the Snitch to win their first match against the Haitian National Team as Haiti were disqualified after an unusual and illegal Snitch capture by one of their Beaters (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum (born 1976) was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Silva must have been born after 1976.
Tony is the short form of the name Anthony (or Antonio), which is of unknown Etruscan (Roman) origin, although one theory is that it means "priceless, inestimable" (Baby Namespedia).
Silva, a common Portuguese surname, derives from the Latin word silva meaning "forest, woodland" (Wikipedia).
As he comes from Brazil, Silva may possibly have attended the Castelobruxo Wizarding School.
