"Bloncourt appeared to lose his head at this point, wrestling the Snitch out of his undergarments and holding it up triumphantly...."
-- match report Brazil v Haiti, Daily Prophet, 15 May 2014 (QWC)
Jean-Baptiste Bloncourt is a Beater for the Haiti National Team at the Quidditch World Cup in 2014.
As a participant at the 2014 tournament, Bloncourt single-handedly wrecked Haiti’s chances at the tournament in their first-round match against Brazil. Having accidentally hit the Haitian Seeker Jolicoeur moments before Jolicoeur would have caught the Snitch, Bloncourt then committed a Snitchnip, resulting in Haiti’s immediate disqualification from the tournament. After the match, he was reported to be in hiding (QWC).
Mistakes and mis-hit Bludgers
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (QWC), Bloncourt must have been born after 1976.
The name Jean-Baptiste is from John the Baptist, a Biblical person. Several famous people from Haiti have borne the same name, including painters Jean-Baptiste Bottex and Jean-Baptiste Jean, and the abolitionist Jean-Baptiste Chavannes.
Bloncourt may come from the Haitian painter and photographer Gérald Bloncourt.
