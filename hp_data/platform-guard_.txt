Gender Male Species / Race Muggle Blood Status Muggle
Profession Platform guard

The platform guard at King’s Cross station was a Muggle who was unaware of Hogwarts and unable to give Harry any useful information when he tried to find out how to get to the Hogwarts Express.
After the Dursleys leave Harry near the clearly marked Platforms 9 and 10, he decides to ask the guard about the train to Hogwarts but refrains from asking about the apparently absent Platform 9 3/4. The guard gets annoyed with Harry when it turns out he doesn’t even know where the school is located. After telling Harry that no trains depart at 11:00, the guard walks away grumbling about having his time wasted (PS6).
