First Introduced GF12: The Triwizard Tournament

Gryffindor, 1994 – 2001 (GF12).
Natalie’s name comes from a Canadian girl who was very sick. She loved the Harry Potter books and contacted JKR. The author wrote her and told her some of the secrets of the books to come, but Natalie had died by the time the letter arrived. Natalie’s mother responded and she and JKR have since become friends. Jo put Natalie in GF, sorted into Gryffindor, as a tribute (interview).
