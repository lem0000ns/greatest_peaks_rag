First Introduced HBP13: The Secret Riddle

Amy Benson was a child from the orphanage whom Tom Riddle once terrorized in a seaside cave (HBP13).
The two childrenÂ never recovered from their ordeal in the cave, according to Mrs Cole. She was probably a few years younger than Riddle, as he describes her as 'little Amy Benson' (HBP13).
Amy Benson lived in the orphanage, so presumably all her family were dead.
