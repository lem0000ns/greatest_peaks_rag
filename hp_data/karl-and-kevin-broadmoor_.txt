First Introduced QA7: Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland

Karl and Kevin Broadmoor are brothers who were the Beaters for the Falmouth Falcons Quidditch team. They are known their misbehaviour on the pitch. During the eleven years that they played Quidditch for the Falcons (1958-1969), they received fourteen suspensions from the Department of Magical Games and Sports (QA7).
Good Quidditch players but a bit lively on the fouling front
Karl is the German or Scandinavian form of the name Charles, derived from a Germanic word meaning "man" (Behind the Name).
Kevin is the English form of Irish Caoimhín, derived from an older Irish name Cóemgein (cóem "kind, gentle, handsome" and gein "birth") (Behind the Name).
Broadmoor is a place name in Britain. Broad means "large" or "wide" and a moor is "open uncultivated upland". Broadmoor is the name of the Broadmoor Mental Hospital in Berkshire and also a village in Pembrokeshire (Wikipedia).
For them to have been suspended from playing Quidditch fourteen times the fouls they committed must have been very serious indeed.
