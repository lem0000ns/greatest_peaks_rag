First Introduced PS7: The Sorting Hat

“Urgh — essence of Millicent Bulstrode . . . Bet it tastes disgusting.”
-- Ron Weasley, as Hermione started to drink Polyjuice Potion (CS12)
Slytherin, 1991 – 1998 (PS7)
Member of Umbridge’s Inquisitorial Squad in her fifth year (OP32). In her second year, Millicent partnered Hermione at the Duelling Club at Snape’s direction, resorting to a headlock despite the standard “no contact” rule of wizard duelling, leaving some black hair on Hermione’s robes in the process … which the quick-witted Hermione saved for use in her Polyjuice Potion. Unfortunately, the hair was not Millicent’s own; apparently she keeps a cat (CS11, CS12).
An “M. Bulstrode” checked out Quidditch Through the Ages (6 February) (QA).
Black-haired (or Hermione wouldn’t have made her mistake), with a square build and heavy jaw, Millicent was “no pixie” in her second year (referring to her size and build); by their fifth year she was still able to physically overpower Hermione. Both Ron and Harry consider Millicent ugly; she reminds Harry in particular of a hag (CS11, OP32).
Physical strength
From the Old French Melisende, from Old High German Amalasuntha,  amal ‎(“work”) + swinth ‎(“strength”).
In 2001 Rowling flashed a notebook during a BBC interview that showed her notes on the students in Harry Potter's year and Millicent is noted as being a Half-blood. However, Millicent's ancestry cannot be considered canon without confirmation from Rowling, because the notebook conflicts in too many places with the stories as they were actually published (HPM).
