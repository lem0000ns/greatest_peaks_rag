The successful Japanese Quidditch team, Toyohashi Tengu, narrowly missed a win over the Gorodok Gargoyles of Lithuania when they played each other in a 1994 match. With Quidditch growing in popularity in Asia only during the last century, this was considered a good result against for the Tengu against an established European team (QA8).
