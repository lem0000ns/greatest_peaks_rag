Profession Hogwarts Professor, subject unknown
First Introduced CG: The Crimes of Grindelwald

Prendergast was a professor at Hogwarts at the time of Leta Lestrange and Newt Scamander (CG).
Professor Prendergast must not have been a fan of Newt’s love for all creatures because he gave Newt a month’s detention for saying “there are no strange creatures, only blinkered people,” a quote which Leta remembered and repeated in 1927 when she ran into Newt at the Ministry of Magic. She reminisced that she set off a dung bomb under Prendergast’s desk so she could share the detention with Newt.
Possibly named for a suburb of Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, Wales
There is a place called Prenderguest, near Ayton, Berwickshire, Scotland, where 12th century Norman Knight Maurice de Prendergast, was born. He later emigrated to Ireland, County Mayo.
Possibly Germanic in origin, "from "brandgeest" = brand meaning "fire" and geest meaning "wasteland"
