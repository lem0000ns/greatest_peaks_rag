Wigtown
Wigtown is located in the Southwest of Scotland (on the shores of Wigtown Bay in Dumfries and Galloway).
The town is home to the Wigtown Wanderers Quidditch team – a member of the British and Irish Quidditch League. Kennilworthy Whisp wrote about the team in his book The Wonder of Wigtown Wanderers (QA).
Wigtown is also the home of Walter Parkin and his seven children. They formed the Wanderers team in 1422 (QA7).
Wigtown has held an annual Book Festival since 1999 and was named "Scotland's National Book Town" (Wigtown Book Festival). There are not, however, any wizard activities mentioned on its Wikipedia page, in spite of their fielding a Quidditch team and a known family of wizarding butchers (Wikipedia).
