Augusta “Gran” Longbottom


First Introduced PS7: The Sorting Hat

Algie tried to trick Neville into showing some magical ability as a child. Pushed him off the end of Blackpool Pier once and nearly drowned him. Algie held Neville out of an upstairs window when he was eight and accidentally dropped him, only to see the boy bounce all the way down the garden and into the road; this was cause for great rejoicing in the Longbottom family. Bought Trevor the Toad for Neville (PS7) and brought a Mimbulus mimbletonia (OP10) for Neville.
Tracked down the rare Mimbulus mimbletonia plant in Assyria.
"AL-gee" = could be an abbreviation for Algernon, which means "with whiskers." Could also be a pun on the green one-celled fungus known as "algae."
