Bandon Banshee


					Bandon Banshee
			
Gender Female Species / Race banshee
First Introduced CS6: Gilderoy Lockhart

"I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!"
--Gilderoy Lockhart (who didn't actually get rid of her at all) (CS6)
The Bandon Banshee was a banshee defeated by a witch with a hairy chin, although Gilderoy Lockhart claimed credit for the defeat (CS6, CS16, CS – Edits and Changes to the Text).
Formerly, the banisher of the Bandon Banshee was described by Lockhart as a witch with a harelip. In 2004 Bloomsbury officially amended the original text.
