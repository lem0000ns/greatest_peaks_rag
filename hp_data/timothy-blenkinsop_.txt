First Introduced DP4: Daily Prophet Issue 4

"Everywhere I looked people were collapsing. A lot of the Harpy supporters were using the Jelly-Brain jinx."
-- Timothy Blenkinsop, interviewed by the Daily Prophet (DP4)
Timothy Blenkinsop is a supporter of the Puddlemere United Quidditch team in the 1990s (DP4).
Interviewed by the Daily Prophet, Blenkinsop was 23 at the time of Puddlemere’s 30 September match against the Holyhead Harpies. He was caught in the ensuing riot and still had a tail resulting from having been hit by a stray curse fired into the crowd by a Harpy supporter (DP4).
Timothy is the English form of the Greek name Τιμοθεος (Timotheos), meaning "honouring God". It is derived from τιμαω (timao) "to honour" and θεος (theos) "god" (Behind the Name).
Blenkinsop is a locational surname derived from Blenkinsopp, a village in the county of Northumberland. It may be constructed from Blenkyn's hill (a hill that belonged to a man called Blenkyn) combined with copp, meaning "a hill top" (Internet Surname Database).
Although the date printed on the fourth Daily Prophet Newsletter (DP4) is 1 October 1999, the timeframe for this event is 1992-1993.
