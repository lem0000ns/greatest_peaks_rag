"I ask our fans to be patient"
-- Ragmar Dorkins (DP1)
Ragmar Dorkins was the manager of the Chudley Cannons Quidditch team in the 1990s, a team with a notoriously bad record.
He spoke to the Daily Prophet about Seeker Galvin Gudgeon’s terrible performance against the Appleby Arrows (DP1) and is further reported to be delighted after the Cannons draw against the Caerphilly Catapults (DP2).
Dorkins is in tears after a win over the Wigtown Wanderers, which breaks the team’s seventeen game losing streak (DP3). Finally, he collapses in shock when the Cannons beat the Falmouth Falcons (DP4).
The name Ragmar is very similar to the Scandinavian name Ragnar, which originally derived from the Germanic name Raganhar (meaning ragin "advice", hari "army") (Behind the Name).
Dorkins is a variant of the name Dawkin, which may derive from the given name David (meaning "beloved") or the nickname daw (from the black and loud jackdaw) (Internet Surname Database).
