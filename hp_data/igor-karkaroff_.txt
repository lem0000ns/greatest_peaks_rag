First Introduced GF15: Beauxbatons and Durmstrang

"This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff s too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord's vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold."
-- Severus Snape to Cornelius Fudge (GF36)
Igor Karkaroff was Headmaster of Durmstrang Institute and a former Death Eater. Karkaroff turned in other Death Eaters to the Wizengamot in order to save himself from Azkaban. He ran for his life in June 1995 when the Dark Mark burned into his arm showed that Voldemort had returned (GF35). Found dead “in a shack up north” according to Lupin, presumably murdered by Death Eaters, in the first weeks of the Second Wizarding War (late June or early July 1996) (HBP6).
Played in the Goblet of Fire movie by Predrag Bjelac IMDB
