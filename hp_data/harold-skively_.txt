"I could do with an extra day's holiday around August"
-- letter from Harold Skively to the Daily Prophet (DP1)
Wizard whose letter was published in The Daily Prophet proposing the creation of a new wizarding holiday (DP1)
Mr Skively's letter to the Daily Prophet  is written in support of a new holiday in August to honour the wizard Merlin. He suggests a "Merlin Remembrance Day" but the editor notes that the request seems mainly to be motivated by being able to have an extra day off work (DP1).
Aptly named, as a "skiver" is someone who is always trying to get out of or avoid working (also known as "skiving off").
While the date printed on DP1 is 31 July 1998, the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
