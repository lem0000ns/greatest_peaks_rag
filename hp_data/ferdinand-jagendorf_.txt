"Das finden wir nicht lustig (we don’t find that funny)."
-- Evening Prophet, 8 June 2014 (Pm)
Ferdinand Jägendorf was the coach and manager for the Liechtenstein National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
Managing the team that achieved a shock win over China to qualify for the 2014 Quidditch World Cup tournament, he was not amused by the Americans' kidnapping of Liechtenstein's Augurey mascot, Hans, after their defeat to the US team in the quarter-finals (Pm).
Leadership, organisation, management
Ferdinand is a Germanic name deriving from fardi "journey" and nand "daring, brave" (Behind the Name).
Jägendorf derives from German jägen "to hunt" and dorf "village, backwater". The town of Krnov in the Czech Republic is Jägendorf in German.
