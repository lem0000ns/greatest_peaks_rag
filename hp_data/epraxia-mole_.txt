Profession Headmistress of Hogwarts
First Introduced Pm: Pottermore

Eupraxia Mole was the headmistress of Hogwarts in 1876, when she negotiated an end to a standoff with Peeves by signing a contract allowing the poltergeist certain privileges.
Eupraxia was the Ancient Greek personification of well-being. Â Eupraxia Mole lives up to this by ensuring the well-being of Hogwarts by ameliorating Peeves.
Assuming reasonably long tenures for both Heads involved, Eupraxia Mole was probably the predecessor of Phineas Nigellus Black as Head of Hogwarts.
