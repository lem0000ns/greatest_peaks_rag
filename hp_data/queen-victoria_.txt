Muggle Queen of the United Kingdom and Empress of India, from June 1837 to until her death in January 1901. She served longer than any other monarch of the royal family, and her reign was known as the Victorian era.
Minister for Magic Evangeline Orpington was a close friend of Queen Victoria. The Queen never knew that Orpington was a witch. Many suspect that Orpington interfered in the Crimean War to help her friend (Pm).
Minister for Magic Faris "Spout-hole" Spavin, the longest-serving Minister who was over 140 years old, attended Queen Victoria's funeral wearing an admiral's hat and spats on his shoes, at which point the Ministry told him it was time to move on (Pm).
Queen Victoria married her cousin, German Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, at the age of 21. Together they had a very happy marriage blessed with nine children, 40 grand-children and 37 great-grandchildren.
