In Anthony Trollope's short story "Josephine De Montmorenci" (1869), 'Josephine de Montmorenci' is a fancier-sounding false name used by one very attractive Ms. Puffle who tries to convince an editor to publish a work of fiction actually written by her sister-in-law (source: The Trollope Society: I, II). -BB
