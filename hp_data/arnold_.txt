First Introduced HBP6: Draco’s Detour

Arnold is a Pygmy Puff that Molly Weasley bought for Ginny at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes in the fall of her fifth year (HBP6).  Arnold tends to ride around on Ginny’s shoulder in the Gryffindor common room, which is probably a good thing as Crookshanks seems to have taken an interest in him (HBP14).
