First Introduced GF8: The Quidditch World Cup

“It’s time-out as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine Aidan Lynch!”
-- Ludo Bagman, calling the World Cup match (GF8)
Aidan Lynch played Seeker for Ireland’s National Team at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.
All the members of the Irish team rode Firebolt brooms during the 1994 tournament (PA4, GF8).
During the final match, Lynch was fooled by a Wronski Feint performed by Bulgarian Seeker Viktor Krum and slammed into the ground. He was revived by mediwizards with cups of potion and finished the game, which was won by Ireland (GF8).
The match was overshadowed by the appearance of the Dark Mark and the disturbing events that took place after the end of the game (GF9, QWC).
The name Aidan is derived from Irish Gaelic Aodhán, a familiar form of Aodh, meaning "fiery, bringer of fire" (Wikipedia).
Lynch is from Irish Ó Loingsigh "descendant of Loingseach", a name meaning "mariner" (Behind the Name).
Like the other members of the Irish National Team, Lynch is named for one of J.K. Rowling's friends:
"The Irish Quidditch team players are all named after people I have known." (JKR)
