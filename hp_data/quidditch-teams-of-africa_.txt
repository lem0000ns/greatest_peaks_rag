Quidditch Teams of Africa
The Quidditch Teams of Africa were formed after the broom game was introduced to Africa by European wizards. Most African countries field a national Quidditch side and several of these have featured in Quidditch World Cup tournaments.
The tournament of African Quidditch-playing nations is called the “All-Africa Cup“.

As so many African countries are Muggle football-mad, it is not surprising that they are also Quidditch-mad as well.
It is also likely that the many wizarding schools located in Africa also field Quidditch teams, although there are no specific references to school teams or tournaments:
