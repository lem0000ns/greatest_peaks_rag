First Introduced PA22: Owl Post Again

Ron’s owl, a tiny bird, possibly a Scops owl. “Pig,” as he is called, is very excitable. He annoys Ron and also irritates Hedwig, who apparently doesn’t think Pig has the proper bearing and manners for a post owl (GF3) . Pigwidgeon was given to Ron by Sirius Black, who used Pig for a delivery after Black and Buckbeak’s escape from Hogwarts. Sirius suggested that Ron keep the tiny owl in exchange for the pet rat that Ron lost. Ginny gave Pig his name and it stuck, although Ron would have liked to have changed it (GF5).
