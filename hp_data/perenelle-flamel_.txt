First Introduced PS13: Nicolas Flamel

" ...the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight)."
-- from a large old book checked out by Hermione for a bit of light reading (PS13)
Perenelle Flamel was Nicolas Flamelâ€™s wife (PS17). She and her future husband met while attending Beauxbatons Academy (Pm).
"Perenelle" is a play on the word "perennial'' meaning perpetual and everlasting.
