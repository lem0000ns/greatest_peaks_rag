"Take 'er away, Ern!"
-- Stan Shunpike (PA3)
Ernie Prang was the elderly, bespectacled driver of the Knight Bus. He gave the impression to Harry that he hadn’t mastered the use of the steering wheel (PA3). Ernie, like so many witches and wizards, attended Dumbledore’s funeral (HBP30).
Driving, sort of.
"Ernie" refers to J.K. Rowling's grandfather, Ernie Rowling (Conv).
"prang" = British slang: "wreck, as in an automobile crash."
