Hebridean Black
The Hebridean Black is an aggressive species of dragon, native to the Hebrides Islands of Scotland, that can grow up to thirty feet in length. It is dark with rough scales, ridges along its back, a spiked tail, and bright purple eyes.
The Hebridean Black eats mostly deer, though it has also carried off large dogs and cattle. The McFusty clan, who lives in the Hebrides, has traditionally been responsible for these dragons (FB).
In 1814, a hapless Quidditch team called the Banchory Bangers tried to capture a Hebridean Black to become their team mascot. They were stopped by the  Ministry (QA5).
