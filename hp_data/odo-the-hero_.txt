Odo the Hero is the “dying wizard” about whom was written a drinking song in the Wizarding World. Part of the song goes as follows:
And Odo the hero, they bore him back home
To the place that he’d known as a lad
They laid him to rest with his hat inside out.
And his wand snapped in two, which was sad (HBP22, DH8).
"Odo is a name typically associated with historical figures from the Middle Ages and before. Odo is etymologically related to the names Otho and Otto, and to the French name Odon and modern version Eudes, and to the Italian names Ottone and Udo; all come from the Germanic word ot meaning "possessor of wealth."
