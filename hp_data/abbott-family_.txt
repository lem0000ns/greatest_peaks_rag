Abbott family


					Abbott family
			
Blood Status Half-blood

The Abbott family is a wizarding family that once lived in Godric’s Hollow. The family name was on a headstone in the graveyard in Godric’s Hollow, probably ancestors of Hannah Abbott, since wizarding families tended to live close together in certain villages after the Statute of Secrecy went into effect in 1692 (DH16).
Notable members of the family:
Hannah Abbott
Mrs. Abbott
Neville Longbottom
Rowling considered the Abbott family to be pureblood, but an inconsistency with old notes (that imply that Hannah Abbott is Muggleborn) made Rowling change her answer (JKR). She settled on Hannah Abbott being half-blood, implying that the Abbott family is both magical and Muggle.
Neville joined the Abbott family when he married Hannah Abbott (JKR).
There is a Theophilus Abbot, an American magical historian. It is unknown if there is any relation between the wizarding Abbott and Abbot surnames (Pm).
Abbott is an English and Scottish occupational surname, for someone who works in the household or lands of a nun or priest.
