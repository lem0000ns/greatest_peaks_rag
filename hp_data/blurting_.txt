Blurting
Blurting is the Quidditch foul of locking broom handles with another player to pull him or her off course (QA6).
It will have been one of the 700 fouls committed during the very first Quidditch World Cup match in 1473 (QA6).
To blurt is to say quickly whatever comes first into your head (Oxford English Dictionary).
During the play-off match to determine the third place finish at the Quidditch World Cup in 2014, the brooms of US teammates Darius Smackhammer and Lucas Piquery were locked together due to the flying skills of Japan's Seeker, Noriko Sato. It was not considered to be a foul because they were on the same team (QWC).
