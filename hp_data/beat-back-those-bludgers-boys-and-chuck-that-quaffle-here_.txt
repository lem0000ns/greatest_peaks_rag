Beat Back Those Bludgers, Boys, and Chuck That Quaffle Here
Beat Back Those Bludgers, Boys, and Chuck That Quaffle Here is the team anthem of Puddlemere United Quidditch team (QA7).
This popular Quidditch team song was also recorded by Celestina Warbeck as a fund-raiser for St Mungo’s Hospital (WW).

The song's title has a folksy Country & Western feel to it - and this may be one reason why Fleur Delacour thought listening to Celestina Warbeck's singing over the Wizarding Wireless Network was particularly "'orrible" (HBP16).
