Perpetua Fancourt was the inventor of the lunascope (FW).
Fancourt attended Hogwarts, where she was in Ravenclaw House. She must have been rather young when she invented the lunascope, since she was born in 1900 (FW) and lunascopes were around by 1926 (WFT).
Perpetua: never ending, unchanging (like the movements of heavenly bodies)
