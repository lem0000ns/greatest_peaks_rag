-- Bob Ogden (HBP10)
Bog Ogden was a “short, plump man” who worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement (HBP10).
Ogden wore glasses so thick that they made his eyes look like tiny specks. Albus Dumbledore interviewed Ogden during his search for information about Tom Riddle’s family and saved the memory into his Pensieve. Ogden had visited the Gaunt house to follow up after Morfin Gaunt attacked the Muggle Tom Riddle, and had there been attacked himself by Gaunt (HBP10).
Ogden was given a very hard time by the Morfin Gaunt’s father Marvolo and Dumbledore reports that he had to return later with a Magical Law Enforcement Squad to make the necessary arrests (HBP10).
Bob is the short form of the given name Robert, which comes from the Germanic name Hrodebert - meaning "bright fame" (hrod "fame" and beraht "bright") (Behind the Name).
Ogden is a surname derived from the names of several places and villages in England, and means "the oak valley" (Old English ac "oak" and denu "a valley") (Internet Surname Database).
There is a possible family connection with Ogden's Old Firewhisky - a popular wizarding alcoholic drink (CS6, GF10, Pm:Quidditch). Bob Ogden may also be related to the wizard Tiberius Ogden, who resigned from the Wizengamot over Ministry interference at Hogwarts in the 1990s (OP15, OP31).
