First Introduced BoS: Book of Spells

"It ought to be done now!" "I've tried once already!"
In vain did your teachers cry, "Steady, now, steady!"
So Angus McMangus, it's you I must blame.
It's all your own fault that you didn't win fame.
-- Miranda Goshawk (BoS)
Angus McMangus was a Hogwarts classmate of Miranda Goshawk, author of the Book of Spells.
The Ballad of Angry Angus McMangus by Miranda Goshawk (BoS)
Oh, Angus McMangus, you should have been great.
With talents aplenty, success on a plate
We all thought you'd garner great grades quite securely,
But Angus McMangus, your spells turned out poorly.
I first heard you roar on the day we did Charms,
Your shouting put everyone into alarms,
"I can't - it's a joke - this whole class is a flop!"
Your fist crashing down made experiments stop.
Again and again with just ten minutes gone,
Of each class you would blow up - "no, everything's wrong!
I can't be expected to work in this way!"
And you'd throw half-made jiggers and potions away.
"Calmly," said teachers, and "just give it time!"
But Angus McMangus thinks waiting's a crime.
If he can't do it straight-away, or double-quick,
He'll snatch up his wand and - crack - one broken stick.
"It ought to be done now!" "I've tried once already!"
In vain did your teachers cry, "Steady, now, steady!"
So Angus McMangus, it's you I must blame.
It's all your own fault that you didn't win fame.
Now answer me, students, what did Angus lack?
What didn't he do, which will keep YOU on track?
