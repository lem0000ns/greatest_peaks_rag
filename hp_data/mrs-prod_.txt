"My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms"
-- D.J. Prod testimonial for Kwikspell (CS8)
Wife of warlock D.J. Prod mentioned in a testimonial for Kwikspell, living in Didsbury (CS8)
Probably the same person as Elsie Prod (DP2)
Mrs Prod thought her husband D.J. Prod was useless at charms, but he was able to turn her into a yak after one month's study on the Kwikspell course (CS8)
The obituary of Elsie Prod's husband, Demetrius J. Prod, appears in the Daily Prophet (DP2). If she is this Mrs Prod, she must have recovered from being transfigured!
