"....we were surprised when the Norwegian delegation announced that they would also require lake-space for a gigantic lake serpent, the Selma. We had assumed that the Norwegians would be accompanied by their usual troop of performing trolls."
-- Valentina Vázquez, speaking to the press following the Opening Ceremony disaster (Pm)
Valentina Vázquez was President of the Argentinian Council of Magic in 2014.
As Argentina was the host country for the 2014 Quidditch World Cup, President Vázquez spoke on behalf of the organisers of the Opening Ceremony on 12 April 2014, following the unfortunate bloodbath caused by the team mascot display (Pm).
