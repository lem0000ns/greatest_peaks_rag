First Introduced GF30: The Pensieve

"Rosier is dead ... He preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle."
-- Barty Crouch, Sr. (GF30)
Evan Rosier was a Death Eater during the first war with Voldemort. He chose to go down fighting against the Aurors, taking with him a chunk of Mad-Eye Moody‘s nose when he died (GF30).
During the trial of Igor Karkaroff at the Ministry, he gave Rosier’s name, not realizing he was already known and deceased.
Rosier's age is unknown, but there was a Rosier mentioned by Dumbledore as a "devoted friend" of Tom Riddle's during his first rise as Dark Lord (HBP20). Whether that was the same  Evan Rosier killed by Moody, or whether there was both an older and younger Rosier in the same family, is uncertain.
Violent duelist against the Aurors.
