-- match report in the Daily Prophet (DP2)
Finbar Quigley is the Captain of the Ballycastle Bats quidditch team and plays in the position of Beater (DP1, DP2).
If eligible to play for Ireland, he is possibly the same person as the Quigley who a member of the Irish National Team that won the 1994 Quidditch World Cup (GF8).
When interviewed by the Daily Prophet, he refuses to say anything bad about Holyhead Harpies captain Gwenog Jones, as the people who do seem to turn into woodlice (DP1).
In the match report published by the Daily Prophet following the win against the Tutshill Tornados, he claims Tornados’ Keeper Mervyn Fenwick had been perfectly fine prior to Quigley’s hitting a Bludger directly at him (DP2).
Finbar is a typically Irish or Celtic name meaning "blond".
Quigley is an ancient Irish surname deriving from the Gaelic nickname O'Coigligh (given to "an untidy person" or someone "long haired") (Internet Surname Database).
