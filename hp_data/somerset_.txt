Somerset
Somerset is a county in the West Country of England, home to both Bath and Exmoor. It is also the home of the Modesty Rabnott Golden Snidget Reservation, and the site of a well-known disaster in the summer of 1996 when a group of Death Eaters, together with at least one giant, caused widespread destruction that the Muggles blamed on a hurricane (HBP1).
