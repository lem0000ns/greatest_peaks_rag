Montrose
Montrose is a small port town with about 10,000 residents found on the eastern shores of Scotland, between Aberdeen and Dundee. More importantly, however, it is home of the Montrose Magpies, the most successful team in the history of the British and Irish Quidditch League. It was also the origin of Guthrie Lochrin’s now-famous broom flight to Arbroath in 1107, which gave him “splinter-filled buttocks and bulging piles” (QA1).
