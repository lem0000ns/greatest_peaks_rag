Scotland
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was the first thing I concentrated on. I was thinking of a place of great order but immense danger, with children who had skills with which they could overwhelm their teachers. Logically, it had to be set in a secluded place and pretty soon I settled on Scotland, in my mind.

Scotland is a beautiful country located in the North of the United Kingdom and is part of Great Britain. It is famous for its lochs, its rolling hills, and its rain that makes everything green almost all the time. It is where much of the Harry Potter stories are set, as it is the home country for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, as well as the neighboring town of Hogsmeade (Nr).
The extremely dangerous game of Creaothceann was also played in Scotland during the Middle Ages, but was banned in 1762 because of the tremendous number of fatalities (QA2).

Hogwarts was founded in the Highlands of Scotland around 900 AD. There were certainly no large stone structures in Scotland at that time ... at least not that Muggles knew of. One can't help but wonder if the castle was created then or if originally the school building was very different --SVA
