United States
A country located in the center of North America and spanning the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the United States is home to the towns of Fitchburg, Salem, and Sweetwater, and is also the natural habitat of the clabbert and the doxy. We also know that Quidditch is not particularly popular there thanks to Quodpot â€“ a game invented by Abraham Peasegood which is played almost exclusively in the U.S. (QA8).
