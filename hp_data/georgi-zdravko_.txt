First Introduced Pm: Pottermore

Georgi Zdravko played Keeper for the Bulgarian National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
Bulgarian fans were nervous about Zdravko’s ability to keep opposing Chasers from scoring goals at the Quidditch World Cup 2014 tournament (Pm).
During the New Zealand game he let in 17 goals and there were only further two goals in the quarter-final against Norway due to Viktor Krum’s early Snitch capture in the forty-second minute. It was the 46 goals scored against them in their semi-final win over Japan that was causing supporters of Bulgaria to worry (Pm).
However, they were victorious in the final match of the tournament, beating Brazil by 170 points to 60, and letting Viktor Krum finally fulfil his Quidditch World Cup dream after so many years of trying (Pm).
Since his teammate Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Zdravko must have been born after 1976.
Georgi (English: George) comes from the Greek Γεωργιος (Georgios), deriving from the Greek γεωργος (georgos) "farmer, earthworker". This breaks down into γη (ge) "earth" and εργον (ergon) "work" (Behind the Name).
According to Wikipedia, Zdravko is a given name that means "healthy." A number of real-life athletes bear this name, including Bulgarian footballer (soccer player) Zdravko Zdravkov.
