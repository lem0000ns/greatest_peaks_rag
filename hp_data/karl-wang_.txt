"[Kristoffersen] banged her head on it until dragged to her feet by Keeper Karl Wang."
-- match report Bulgaria v Norway, Daily Prophet, 6 June 2014 (Pm)
Karl Wang played Keeper for the Norwegian National Team at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014 (Pm).
Although a member of one of the teams predicted to win the 2014 tournament, his team did win against a weak Ivory Coast side in their first match but was then beaten by Viktor Krum’s early catch of the Snitch during their quarter-final against Bulgaria (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Wang must have been born after 1976.
Karl is the Scandinavian form of Charles, which means "manly and strong, a free man" (Quick Baby Names).
Although Wang is the most common mainland Chinese surname, it is completely unrelated to the same surname in Scandinavia, which is a form of the name Vang, derived from Old Norse vangr meaning "field or meadow" (Wikipedia).
