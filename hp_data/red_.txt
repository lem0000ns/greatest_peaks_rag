Red uses a long clawed stick to reach an elevator button above his head.
Red was a Goblin bellboy who operated an elevator at MACUSA during the winter of 1926.
Red used a long clawed stick to reach an elevator button to the Major Investigation Department that was above his head. He took Porpentina Goldstein and Newt Scamander to the Major Investigation Department despite an initial objection to Tina’s order (WFT).
After Tina asks to be taken to the Major Investigation Department, Red replies, "I thought you was -", indicating he knew Tina was no longer an Auror.
