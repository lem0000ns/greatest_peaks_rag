First Introduced DP1: Daily Prophet Issue 1

"I was surprised to see that the Daily Prophet did not cover our resounding triumph"
-- Mr Rufford's letter to the Daily Prophet (DP1)
Grugwyn Rufford was a disgruntled member of the Welsh National Gobstones Team, who complained to the Daily Prophet (DP1)
Rufford was upset because they didn't cover the Welsh victory over Hungary and focus instead on trivial Quidditch articles. The editor responded that this is because most wizards found Gobstones to be "deeply boring" (DP1)
While the date printed on DP1 is 31 July 1998, the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
