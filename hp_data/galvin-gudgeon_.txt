First Introduced DP1: Daily Prophet Issue 1

"....Gudgeon was singled out for blame by fans, after missing the Snitch at least a dozen times"
-- match report in the Daily Prophet  (DP1)
Galvin Gudgeon played Seeker for the Chudley Cannons Quidditch team (DP1).
Cannons manager Ragmar Dorkins implored fans not to curse Gudgeon during the match, since "turning him into a toad will not help his game." Gudgeon did miss several excellent opportunities during the match against the Appleby Arrows when the Snitch twice bounced off his nose. In a previous match against the Tornados, Gudgeon fell off his broom while trying to catch a passing bumble-bee (DP1).
"Gudgeon" = from Latin 'gobion,' variant of 'gobius,' = from Middle English 'gudyon' via Old French 'goujon') something used as bait; a gullible person.
While the date printed on DP1 is 31 July 1998, the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
