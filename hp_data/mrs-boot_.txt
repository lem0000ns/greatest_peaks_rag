First Introduced MNA: Magic in North America (essays)

Mrs. Boot was a witch who took her family to America in the early 1600s in search of adventure. On the journey across the Atlantic, Mrs. Boot and her family became friends with a Muggle man named James Steward. Once in America, the Boots encountered a Hidebehind in the woods. After her husband mistook the unfamiliar creature for a Boggart, the Hidebehind killed Mrs. and Mr. Boot. Their two young sons, Chadwick and Webster, survived but were seriously injured.
Mr. and Mrs. Boot’s bodies were saved from being disemboweled by the Hidebehind when Isolt Sayre and William appeared and fought off the creature. Their bodies were not buried for some time, however (Pm).
