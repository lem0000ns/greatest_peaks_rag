"Seeker Aidan Kiely seized his opportunity in the fourth hour of play ..."
-- match report in the Daily Prophet (DP2)
Aidan Kiely played Seeker for the Kenmare Kestrels (c. 1993).
As reported in the Daily Prophet article “Maddock Blamed for Kestrels’ Win“, Kiely’s capture of the Snitch won a game against the Montrose Magpies following a mis-directed kick (of the Snitch) by the controversial Magpies Chaser Alasdair Maddock (DP2).
Aidan is an Anglicised form of the Irish Celtic name Aodhán (Áedán, from Áed, meaning "fire") (Behind the Name).
Kiely derives from Old Gaelic O'Cadhla meaning "male descendant of" plus "graceful or beautiful" (Internet Surname Database). This player's name could also be a reference to Aine Kiely, a friend of J.K. Rowling.
