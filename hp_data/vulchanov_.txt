First Introduced GF8: The Quidditch World Cup

"Volkov and Vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air."
-- watching the 1994 Quidditch World Cup (GF8)
Vulchanov was a Beater on the Bulgarian National Team at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.
Along with the other Bulgarian Beater Volkov, Vulchanov was a member of the Bulgarian team in 1994 that lost the Quidditch World Cup final to Ireland. The team included a very young Viktor Krum as Seeker. His other teammates were Dimitrov, Ivanova and Levski (Chasers), and Zograf (the Keeper) (GF8).
He and Volkov are “legendary” figures and are considered to be the best pair of Beaters in living memory (Pm).
Ruthlessness and legendary beating skills
His son, Boris, is also a Beater and was a member of the winning Bulgarian side in the 2014 Quidditch World Cup (Pm).
Vulchanov means "volcano" and derives from the Bulgarian word вулка́н (vulkan) (Dictionary.com) and it is a similar name to Bulgarian cinema actor and director Rangel Valchanov (Wikipedia).
He may be descended from the Bulgarian witch Nerida Vulchanova, the founder of the Durmstrang Institute (Pm).
A videogame with Famous Wizards cards gives him a first name of "Pyotr".
