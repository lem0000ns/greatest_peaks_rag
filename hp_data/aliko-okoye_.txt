"The precision and creativity of shots hit by Okoye and Ojukwe...."
-- match report by Ginny Weasley in the Daily Prophet (QWC)
Aliko Okoye was a Beater for the Nigerian National Quidditch Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
A member of the Nigerian team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup tournament, Okoye and his Beater teammate Mercy Ojukwu, were described as “ferocious” during their match against Fiji, which was won by a margin of 400 points to Fiji’s 160 (QWC).
Although the team had been one of the favourites to win the tournament, they fell out at the quarter-final stage, losing to the Japan National Team by 270 points to 100, following a dangerous broom failure. However, both the Nigerian and Japanese Beaters were praised for their artistic “precision and creativity” during this match by the Daily Prophet (QWC).
Artistic, creative and precise hitting of Bludgers
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (QWC), Okoye must have been born after 1976.
Aliko is a boy's name, probably short for Alexander, a Greek name meaning "defender of humankind" (Quick Baby Names). According to his Wikipedia entry, billionaire Aliko Dangote, a Nigerian businessman, is the richest man in Africa.
