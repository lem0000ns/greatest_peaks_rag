First Introduced GF1: The Riddle House

A maid at the Riddle House was the first person to find the dead bodies of Tom Riddle, Sr., and his parents. After coming across the corpses in the drawing room in the early morning, the maid ran into Little Hangleton, screaming and waking whomever she could (GF1).
The fact that the Riddle House was "well kept and impressive", and that the Riddles could afford to maintain a staff of at least three servants (a cook, a maid, and a gardener are mentioned during the course of the chapter) in the post-war labor market tells us that they were very well off indeed. We are not told whether the cook and the maid were live-in staff, but the fact that the maid was in the Riddle House at daybreak at all suggests that she was at least a full-time employee.
