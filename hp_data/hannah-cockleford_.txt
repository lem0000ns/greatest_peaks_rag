Hannah Cockleford was a fifteenth-century English witch.
In 1484, Hannah Cockleford attended a jousting tournament that took a dark turn when the Earl of Paunchley decided to punish an injured boy named Edmund Gaddlegate. The earl charged at Edmund with his lance and Hannah - outraged by the nobleman's cruelty - cast a powerful Shield Charm to protect the boy from further harm (BoS).
