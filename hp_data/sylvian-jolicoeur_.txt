"Jolicoeur was within inches of capturing the Snitch when he was hit by another of Bloncourt’s poorly aimed Bludgers...."
-- match report Haiti v Brazil, Daily Prophet, 15 May 2014 (Pm)
Sylvian Jolicoeur played Seeker for the Haitian National Team at the Quidditch World Cup in 2014.
In Haiti’s first-round match against Brazil at the 2014 tournament, Jolicoeur was knocked out by a poorly hit Bludger from his teammate, Bloncourt, just before he would have caught the Snitch. He made a good recovery afterwards (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Jolicoeur must have been born after 1976.
Sylvian comes from the word sylvan meaning "wooded, associated with woods", which itself derives from the Latin word silva ("wood, forest") (Oxford English Dictionary). A similar, more common French name is Sylvain meaning "man of the woods" (Baby Namespedia). There were also two Haitian Presidents named Sylvain: Sylvain Salnave and Franck Sylvain.
Jolicoeur may refer to the Haitian journalist Aubelin Jolicoeur. It derives from Old French word joli ‎meaning "pretty, smart, joyful, merry" and the French word for "heart", coeur.
There are two Seekers in the 2014 Quidditch World Cup tournament with the unusual name of Sylvian - Sylvian Boigny from Ivory Coast and Sylvian Jolicoeur of Haiti, although the latter is definitely a male.
