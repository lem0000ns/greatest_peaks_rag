"Muggle fireplaces aren't supposed to be connected, strictly speaking — but I've got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me."
-- Mr Weasley to the Dursleys (GF4)
Arthur Weasley’s contact at the Floo Regulation Panel was a Ministry of Magic employee who was involved with the Floo Regulation Panel. In the summer of 1994, he bent the Panel’s rule against connecting Muggle fireplaces to the Floo Network so that Arthur could collect Harry Potter from Privet Drive (GF4).
