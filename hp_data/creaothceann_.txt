Creaothceann
"They strapped on their cauldrons, stood poised to fly,
At the sound of the horn they were swiftly airborne...."
-- translation of Gaelic poem (QA2)
Creaothceann, popular in the Middle Ages and invented in Scotland, it is considered to be probably the most dangerous of all broom games (QA2).
Playing the game involves trying to catch hundreds of falling rocks and boulders within cauldrons strapped to the players’ heads. It inevitably caused huge numbers of fatalities and was banned in 1762 (QA2).
Creaothceann was the subject of a poem in Gaelic in the eleventh century, referring to ten men out of twelve being killed during a match (QA2).
A campaign by Magnus ‘Dent-Head’ Macdonald tried to overturn the ban in the 1960s, but was unsuccessful in convincing the Ministry of Magic to do so (QA2).
Quidditch Through the Ages author Kennilworthy Whisp wondered whether the “Scottish warlock” mentioned by Gertie Keddle at a game played on Queerditch Marsh had introduced the concept of flying rocks from Creaothceann (QA3).
The Scottish (and Irish) Gaelic word ceann means "head" and the word creach/creagh is a "raid or foray" - or the plunder and booty obtained thereon (Dictionary of the Scots Language).
Somehow flying around on brooms trying to catch rocks in cauldron-topped helmets really does not appeal.... Wizards certainly have a different view of health and safety than Muggles.
