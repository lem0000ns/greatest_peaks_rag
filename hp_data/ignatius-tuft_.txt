Ignatius Tuft was Minister for Magic from 1959 to 1962. He succeeded his mother, Wilhelmina, in the office by capitalizing on her popularity following her untimely death. He was forced to resign after promising to institute a controversial Dementor breeding program.
Tuft was either half-blood or pureblood, since his mother was a witch.
Tuft's muggle counterpart was Harold Macmillan.
