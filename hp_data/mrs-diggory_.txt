First Introduced GF31: The Third Task

"He suffered very little then, ...And after all, ... he died just when he'd won the tournament.  He must have been happy."
-- Mrs. Diggory on her late son, Cedric (GF37)
Mrs. Diggory was Cedric Diggory’s mother and Amos Diggory’s wife. She was not as emotional as her husband. When Cedric died, she was at Hogwarts and met with Professor Sprout, the head of Hufflepuff House, Dumbledore, and then Harry (GF36, GF37).
Spouse: Amos Diggory
Son: Cedric Diggory
Mrs. Diggory was not in charge of her husband's care in the year 2020 when Voldemort's daughter Delphi was able to insinuate herself into St. Oswald's Home for Witches and Wizards to Confund Amos into thinking she was his niece. So it's a good guess that Cedric's mother was dead by that time (CC1.6).
Her character was left out of the film version of Goblet of Fire.
