Gorodok Gargoyles 
A Quidditch team from Lithuania in Northern Europe.
The Gargoyles narrowly defeated Japan's Toyohashi Tengu team in a 1994 Quidditch match (QA8).
"Gorodok" means little town or "townlet" in Russian. The boundaries of Russia, Lithuania and Belarus have shifted over time, as have the languages spoken.
According to Wikipedia, there are several towns in Russia named "Gorodok" and one in Belarus, but none currently listed for Lithuania (unless it is too small to be noted). There is also a Gorodok Stadium inside the Luzhniki Olympic Complex. No Quidditch teams could be found in any of these locations (Wikipedia: Gorodok).
