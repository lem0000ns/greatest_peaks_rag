Gender Male Species / Race Goblin

Nagnok may not be canon; his name was mentioned in the third W.O.M.B.A.T. test posted on jkrowling.com as a possible answer to the question “Which of the following did NOT provoke one of the bloody goblin rebellions of the 17th and 18th centuries?” According to the test Nagnok was a Gringotts Goblin who might have died at the hands of an untrained security troll sent by the Ministry of Magic (JKR).
