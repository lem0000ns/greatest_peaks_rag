The youngest of twin daughters born to Isolt Sayre and James Steward, Rionach was named for her maternal grandmother. During the attack on Ilvermorny when she and her sister Rioach were babies, it was their frightened screams that broke the curse upon their parents and thwarted Gormlaith Gauntâ€™s plans.
As an adult, Rionach taught Defence Against the Dark Arts at Ilvermorny for many years. It was rumoured that Rionach spoke Parseltongue and that the reason she never married or had children was not to pass on her Slytherin ancestry, unaware that the Gaunt line continued in England.
