Anti-Muggle security
Anti-Muggle security is the practice of precautions to ensure that Muggles donâ€™t notice anything magical.
Anti-Muggle Security measures were in effect for the Quidditch World Cup campground on Dartmoor (GF7) and for the Celestina Warbeck concert on Exmoor (JKR). Zacharius Mumps began his famous book about Quidditch with a discussion of anti-Muggle security (QA5).
