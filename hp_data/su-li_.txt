Ravenclaw? 1991 – 1998.
Su's name appears in the draft of the classlist of Harry's year that Jo displayed during the "Harry Potter and Me" TV interview (HPM). According to the classlist she is half-blood. Su has never appeared in canon, but her name is listed here because she apparently existed in early plans for the books. [Essay on the classlist]
