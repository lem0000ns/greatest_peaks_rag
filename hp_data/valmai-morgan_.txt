Valmai Morgan is a Chaser for the all-female Quidditch team Holyhead Harpies in the 1990s.
Morgan replaced Wilda Griffiths on the Harpies’ team and scored ten goals on her debut. Team Captain Gwenog Jones was “cock-a-hoop” at the result (DP3).
She also scored for the Harpies in the grudge match against Puddlemere United, putting them into the lead when Griffiths mysteriously disappeared from the pitch (DP4).
Valmai is a Welsh girl's name, partly deriving from the word Mai (meaning the month of May or denoting springtime) and may mean "Mayflower" (BabyNamespedia). Another possibility is that it is a female form of the Welsh boy's name Gwalchmai ("Hawk of May") and which becomes the name Gawain in Arthurian legend. Note: There is no letter "v" in the Welsh language.
Morgan was originally the first name Morcant, which evolved into Morgan during the medieval period. Y môr means "the sea" in Welsh and the name is thought to mean "sea chief" or "sea defender" (Internet Surname Database).
