Abbreviation JKR (Wizard of the Month)

The Wizard of the Month calendar features a famous witch or wizard each month. Pass your cursor over it; it flips up to name the honoree, circling it in red. Click it, the page tears off and shows a picture of the character, (birth – death dates) and noteworthy recognition or description.
The calendar shows today’s date according to your computer’s system. As of Sept. 30, 2004 it updates automatically on the first of the month at midnight GMT (or BST) even though the calendar still reads the date on your system.
Wizards of the Month have always alternated male and female, except Oct-Nov 2005, when there were two witches and Apr-May 2006, two wizards in a row. On the one year anniversary of the site Felix Summerbee reappeared for a second run as Wizard of the Month for May.
The calendar also displays Happy Birthday greetings occasionally which appear automatically at midnight UK time and remain for 24 hours. Click here for a list of all the birthdays.
For the first year and a half all the characters were taken from the Famous Wizards Cards until October 2005 when Fifi LaFolle became our first NEW canon character. Since that time, there have been many new characters along with FW card honorees.

The image of Salazar Slytherin was changed on June 1 to fit the frame. The image of Albus Dumbledore was the only one which had no movement at all.
