Yusuf Kama was a French wizard of Senegalese ancestry. He claimed to be the last male in his pure-blood family line. He was born c. 1884, the son of Laurena and Mustafa Kama, and half-brother of Leta Lestrange.
In 1927, Yusuf Kama tracked Credence Barebone to Paris having taken an Unbreakable Vow to track Credence down and kill him because he believed him to be Corvus Lestrange, the son of Corvus Lestrange IV who had cast an Imperious Curse on Yusuf’s mother to seduce and abduct her.
When he learned that Corcus was already dead he displayed a more moral and selfless side, rejected Grindelwald’s persuasive speech and risked his own life to save Nagini from the blue fire caused by the Firedrakes. He went on the assist Nicolas Flamel, as well as other former enemies, by conjuring purifying orange flames to save the city from the conflagration.
Kama joined the Global Wizarding War on the side opposing Grindelwald, and journeyed to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to meet with Albus Dumbledore (CG)
