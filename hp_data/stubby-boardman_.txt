First Introduced OP10: Luna Lovegood

"What people don't realise is that Sirius Black is a false name ... The man people believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Boardman, lead singer of popular singing group The Hobgoblins ... Â I recognised him the moment I saw his picture in the paper. Now, Stubby couldn't possibly have committed those crimes, because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me."
-- Doris Purkiss in The Quibbler (OP10)
Stubby Boardman was the lead singer of the Hobgoblins who retired c. 1980 after being hit in the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Norton Church Hall (OP10).
