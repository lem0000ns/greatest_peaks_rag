Malodora Grymm


					Malodora Grymm
			
Gender Female Species / Race Hag

Malodora Grymm was a famous hag. She used a beautification potion to conceal her true form, married a king, and used a charmed mirror to reinforce her self-image. She became jealous of the most beautiful girl in the land and fed her a poisoned apple to get rid of her.
The story of Malodora Grymm is a nod to the fairy tale "Snow White," which was part of the collection of the Brothers Grimm, hence the last name "Grymm."
Malodora from "malodorous": foul-smelling  (mal = bad + odor = scent or smell)
