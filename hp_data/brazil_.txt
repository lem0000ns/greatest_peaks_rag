Brazil
The largest country in South America (and also the only one with a primary language of Portuguese, rather than Spanish) Brazil is home to much of the Amazon rainforest.
The snake which Harry freed from the zoo was native to Brazil, though it was bred in captivity (PS2). Bill Weasley once had a penfriend here as well (GF7).
Brazil’s national Quidditch team also reached the World Cup quarterfinals in the last century (QA8). They competed in the 2014 Quidditch World Cup as well (Pm).
Fire slugs are native to the Brazilian rainforest. Newt Scamander spent some time there studying the slugs (FW).
