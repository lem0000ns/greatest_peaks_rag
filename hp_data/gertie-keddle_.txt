First Introduced QA3: The Game From Queerditch Marsh

"That lot from across the marsh have been at it again. Playing a stupid game on their broomsticks"
A nosy witch living on the edge of Queerditch Marsh. She kept a diary that is now kept in the Museum of Quidditch in London. Translated from Saxon, the diary has the first recorded mention of an early version of Quidditch (QA). She provides glimpses of precursors of the Quaffle, goal keeping and Bludgers.
