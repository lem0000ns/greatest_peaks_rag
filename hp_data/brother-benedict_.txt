Profession Franciscan monk
First Introduced Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (book)

Brother Benedict was a Medieval Franciscan monk in Worcestershire who had an encounter with a Jarvey, but thought it was an overlarge ferret. It insulted him, then bit him on the nose. His fellow monks thought he’d overindulged in turnip wine when he told them about it (FB).
