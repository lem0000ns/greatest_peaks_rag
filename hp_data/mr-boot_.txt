First Introduced MNA: Magic in North America (essays)

Mr. Boot was a wizard who took his family to America in the early 1600s in search of adventure. On the journey across the Atlantic, Mr. Boot and his family became friends with a Muggle man named James Steward. Once in America, the Boots encountered a Hidebehind in the woods. Unfamiliar with the creature, Mr. Boot thought it was a Boggart and tried to deal with it by ridiculing it. This did not work, and Mr. Boot and his wife were killed by the Hidebehind. Their two young sons, Chadwick and Webster, survived but were seriously injured.
Mr. and Mrs. Bootâ€™s bodies were saved from being disemboweled by the Hidebehind when Isolt Sayre and William appeared and fought off the creature. Their bodies are not buried for some time, however (Pm).
Apparently competent at dealing with Boggarts (Pm).
