Luxembourg
Luxembourg is a tiny European country sandwiched between France, Germany and Belgium. According to Charlie Weasley, Luxembourgâ€™s Quidditch team slaughtered Scotland in the Quidditch World Cup playoffs of 1994 (GF5).
Bigonville, home of the Bigonville Bombers Quidditch team, is also located in Luxembourg (QA8).
Luxembourg is the seat of the European Court of Justice and also a proudly multi-lingual country. However, although it has both national and professional Quidditch teams, its Wikipedia page does not mention any wizarding sports or wizarding activity of any kind (Wikipedia).
