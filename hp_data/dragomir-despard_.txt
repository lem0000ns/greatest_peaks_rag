“This is Dragomir Despard....He speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark Lord’s aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime."
-- Hermione introducing Ron in disguise at Gringott's Bank
A made-up name given to Ron Weasley while he was in disguise during the Great Gringott’s Caper.
Dragomir: A Slavic name from Romania and Serbia meaning "precious peace" - possibly chosen for its similarity to Draco Malfoy's name, well-known in Slytherin circles. The name, which has the same prefix as "dragon," may also work as foreshadowing for the dragon-rescue from Gringotts later in the chapter.
Despard: Possibly a reference to the Scottish suffragette Charlotte Despard, a believer in women's rights and a War recruiter during WWI. Two streets are named after her in London, one of which ends at a pub of the same name.
