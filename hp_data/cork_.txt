Cork
Cork is both a county and city in the Republic of Ireland. The city is the second largest in Ireland, located on its southern coast.
A Quidditch team from Cork, playing against the Lancashire team in 1385, in Lancashire, had to flee town to escape harm after winning the match (QA8).

Although there are Quidditch teams in Ireland and an historical one from Cork, neither Wikipedia page for the City of Cork (Wikipedia) nor for County Cork (Wikipedia) have any record of wizarding activity noted.
