Proprietor of Borgin and Burkes of Knockturn Alley; an oily, smooth-talking fellow who fawned on Lucius Malfoy during the summer of 1992 but was less than impressed after his customers’ departure (CS4). Draco visited his shop again in late July 1996 to force the shopkeeper to help him repair a broken Vanishing Cabinet, the duplicate of which was in the store. When Draco left, Borgin was visibly shaken (HBP6).
