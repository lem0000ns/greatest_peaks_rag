"....slick defence from Draganov and Vulchanov has so far prevented them from scoring."
-- Ginny Weasley's live commentary for the Daily Prophet, 11 July 2014 (Pm)
Dimitar Draganov was a Beater for the Bulgarian National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
Draganov and his colleague Boris  Vulchanov, the two Beaters for Bulgaria at the 2014 tournament, were considered “competent” but with “great physical courage” (Pm).
The team won their first two matches. It was an easy win against New Zealand in the first round, as one of the opposing team’s Chasers was sent off after a foul. Playing against Norway in the quarter-finals, it was another easy match after Seeker Krum caught an early Snitch. The semi-final match, however, was a hard fought battle against a talented Japanese side, which Bulgaria won by 610 points to 460 (Pm).
Beating Brazil in a thrilling final match (by 170 points to 60), Bulgaria were the winners of the tournament. The Beaters used strong defensive tactics to prevent Brazil’s Chasers from running up the score (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Draganov must have been born after 1976.
Dimitar (Bulgarian: Димитър) comes from Latin name Demetrius via Greek Δημητριος (Demetrios). It is a reference to the Greek goddess Demeter (δα (da) "earth" and μητηρ (meter) "mother") (Behind the Name).
Draganov is a Slavic name meaning "son of Dragan". Dragan derives from Slavic dragu meaning "precious" (Behind the Name).
