"....we took bets around the office. Rufus won; he said it would take ages and he was right."
-- an anonymous source at the Improper Use of Magic Office interviewed by the Daily Prophet (DP2)
Rufus Fudge is the nephew of Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and an employee of the Ministry of Magic.
As part of a “fun” wager, Rufus, who worked in the Improper Use of Magic Office, caused a Muggle tube train to disappear (DP2).
Likes to have some "fun" at work
Fudge (Engl) is to be vague or act falsely, especially when being untruthful or trying to mislead (Oxford English Dictionary).
The Daily Prophet covered Rufus's antics in the article "Enquiry at the Improper Use of Magic Office" (DP2).
Although the date printed on the second Daily Prophet Newsletter (DP2) is 8 February 1999, the timeframe for this event is 1992-1993.
