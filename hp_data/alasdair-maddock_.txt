"I was only trying it for a laugh"
-- Alasdair Maddock to the Daily Prophet (DP1)
Alasdair Maddock is a Quidditch player, a Chaser for the Montrose Magpies (1990s). Maddock is a bit over-interested in Muggle sports, which is documented in a series of articles in the Daily Prophet.
Magpie Chaser “Only Tried Football for a Laugh” – Maddock is photographed in a field trying to “head the ball” like a Muggle football player. It is reported that he also tried to dribble a Quaffle like a basketball during the previous season’s game against the Caerphilly Catapults (DP1).
Maddock blamed for Kestrels’ win – He unsuccessfully tries to kick the Snitch in a game against the Kenmare Kestrels and is threatened by manager Cormack McLeod with being turned into a jellyfish (DP2).
Mugglemaniac Maddock must quit Magpies, says McLeod – Maddock is sacked by McLeod from the Magpies after being caught experimenting with Muggle metal sticks (golf clubs) (DP3).
Alasdair is the Scottish form of the name Alexander which comes from the Greek name Αλεξανδρος (Alexandros), meaning "defending men" (αλεξω (alexo) "to defend, help" and ανηρ (aner) "man") (Behind the Name).
Maddock is a form of the ancient Welsh male given name Matoc (from mad meaning "fortunate, "good") (Internet Surname Database). The legendary Prince Madoc ap Owain Gwynedd "discovered" America 300 years before Columbus.
