					Asha
			
Gender Female

The first of three witches in the story “The Fountain of Fair Fortune” from The Tales of Beedle the Bard. In the account given on Amazon.com, Asha is a witch with an incurable malady who seeks wellness at the fountain. Along the way she meets two other women, Altheda and Amata, and even though the fountain will only let one of them bathe, they decide to help each other out. Asha helps them through the first obstacle, a worm that demands proof of their pain; her tears of frustration eventually win them passage. After the third and final obstacle, however, Asha collapses. Altheda brews a potion that not only revives Asha, it cures her of her illness, and Asha realizes she doesn’t need the fountain after all. (TBB/FFF).
Asha means 'wish, desire, hope' in Hindi, and 'life' in Swahili.
