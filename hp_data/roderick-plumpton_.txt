First Introduced QA10: Quidditch Today

Seeker for the England National Team and the Tutshill Tornados. Holds British record for fastest capture of Golden Snitch during game: three and a half seconds. This happened in 1921 and the move he used to make the catch is now called the Plumpton Pass. Plumpton maintains the catch was totally intentional and not sheer dumb luck (FW, QA10).
Speed and possibly spectacular luck.
