Profession Minister for Magic

Eugenia Jenkins was Minister for Magic from 1968 to 1975.  She dealt “competently” with pure-blood riots and Squib Rights marches, but was not deemed able to deal with the rise of Lord Voldemort.
Eugenia's muggle counterparts would have been Harold Wilson and Edward Heath.
