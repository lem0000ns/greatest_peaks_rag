Atlantic Ocean
Just as with Muggles in aeroplanes, the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by broomstick was an important milestone for wizards, as the distance is too great for safely Apparating. Jocunda Sykes first accomplished this feat in 1935, riding an Oakshaft 79 (QA9).
Isolt Sayre crossed the Atlantic in 1620 disguised as a boy named Elias Story on board the Mayflower. Her aunt, Gormlaith Gaunt, followed later disguised as Isoltâ€™s father, William Sayre (Pm:Ilvermorny).
The Atlantic is also a natural habitat of the sea serpent and the shrake (FB), and in the west near the Carribean, the site of the Bermuda Triangle.
