Quafflepocking
A Quidditch foul, committed by a Chaser, consisting of tampering with the Quaffle to make it fly differently (QA6).
This would have been one of the 700 fouls that is catalogued as having occurred during the 1473 Quidditch World Cup (QA6).
A "pock" or "pockmark" is a skin blemish, usually left as a result of smallpox or other infection. In the case of quafflepocking, it could be referring to the hole made in the Quaffle by the Chaser.
