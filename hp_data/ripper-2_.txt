First Introduced PA2: Aunt Marge’s Big Mistake

Ripper was a bulldog owned by Marge Dursley. He liked to take his tea from Aunt Marge’s saucer.
He always traveled with Marge because he “pines” if he is away from her. Marge had twelve dogs, but Ripper seemed to be her favourite (PA2).
Ripper did not seem to like anyone besides Marge. He seemed to dislike Harry the most, as he growled when they were in the same room (PA2).
"Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to call him off until past midnight" (PA2).
