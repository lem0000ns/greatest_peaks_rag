First Introduced OP23: Christmas on the Closed Ward

Agnes was a patient in the Janus Thickey Ward for permanent spell damage at St. Mungo’s Hospital along with the Longbottoms, Broderick Bode (now deceased) and Gilderoy Lockhart. Agnes’ entire head is covered with fur and she barks instead of speaking (OP23). The Healer told her that her son would soon visit and had sent her several Christmas gifts (OP23).
