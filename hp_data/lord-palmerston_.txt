Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, KG, GCB, PC, FRS (20 October 1784 â€“ 18 October 1865) was a British statesman who served twice as Prime Minister in the mid-19th century. Palmerston dominated British foreign policy during the period 1830 to 1865, when Britain was at the height of her imperial power. He held office almost continuously from 1807 until his death in 1865 (Wikipedia). Minister for Magic Priscilla Dupont developed a deep dislike for Lord Palmerston and actually used magic to annoy him. She was forced to resign because of this behavior. Palmerston himself resigned as Prime Minister a few days later (Pm).
