In the 1960s, Magnus Macdonald attempted to re-introduce the Scottish game of Creaothceann, which was popular in the Middle Ages. This sport involved trying to catch hundreds of falling rocks and Bludgers in cauldrons attached to the player’s heads – and resulted in many deaths. It was originally banned in 1762. Macdonald was ultimately unsuccessful (QA2).
