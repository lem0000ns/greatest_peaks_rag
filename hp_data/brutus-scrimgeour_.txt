First Introduced Quidditch Through the Ages (book)

Brutus Scrimgeour is the author of The Beaters’ Bible (QA6). He also wrote a promotional blurb for the front of Quidditch Through the Ages (QA).
Brutus Scrimgeour is possibly related to Rufus Scrimgeour, but this is not confirmed as canon. The surname, however, is not very common, so it is more likely than not (British Surname Distribution).
Brutus is a Roman name which means "heavy" in Latin. Famous people with the name include Lucius Junius Brutus, the founder of the Roman Republic, and Marcus Junius Brutus, who helped kill Julius Caesar (Behind the Name).
Scrimgeour is a Scottish clan name. It probably originated from a nickname meaning "skirmisher" (a version of escrimeur, which is French for "swordsman") (Internet Surname Database), a fitting name for a bat-wielding Quidditch Beater.
