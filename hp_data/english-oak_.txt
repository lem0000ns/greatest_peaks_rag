English oak
"Wands of English oak demand partners of strength, courage and fidelity."
-- Mr. Ollivander
A wand wood (Pm).
 Hagrid, for instance, has an oak wand though by this Celtic system he should have a wand made of elder; in Britain, the oak is ‘King of the Forest’ and symbolises strength, protection and fecundity; what other wood could ‘choose’ Hagrid?(JKR)
The ancient druids of Britain worshiped trees, especially the English oak. The name "druid" comes from the Greek noun δρύς (drus), meaning "oak-tree", so druid literally means "oak knower" or "oak seer." But these tree-loving wizards were not just interested in plants. According to Julius Caesar, they studied "the stars and their movements, the size of the cosmos and the earth, the world of nature, and the powers of deities." source: Wikipedia
