Profession Quidditch referee
First Introduced Pm: Pottermore

Georgios Xenakis was a Referee at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014 (Pm).
Xenakis refereed the match between New Zealand and Bulgaria, where he made a call to send New Zealand Chaser Dennis Moon off after judging him to have caused a deliberate collision with a Bulgarian Chaser.  This move drew the ire of New Zealand’s manager Charlie Baverstock, and was deemed a crucial factor in Bulgaria’s victory (Pm).
Georgios (English: George) comes from the Greek Γεωργιος (Georgios), deriving from the Greek γεωργος (georgos) "farmer, earthworker". This breaks down into γη (ge) "earth" and εργον (ergon) "work" (Behind the Name).
Xenakis may refer to Thomas Xenakis, a Greek gymnast who participated in the first Olympics of the modern era.
As Georgios is one of the most common first names in Greece, it is possible that he is Greek, or of Greek heritage.
