Canada
Canada is one of the largest countries in the world. It nevertheless has a relatively small population, due largely to its abundance of forests and frigid climates. The country is the home, however, to three of the most accomplished Quidditch teams in the world, based out of the towns of Haileybury, Moose Jaw, and Stonewall (QA8).
Lexicon list of World Quidditch Teams
Although they have fielded National teams that played in Quidditch World Cup tournaments and have three famous Quidditch teams: the Haileybury Hammers, the Moose Jaw Meteorites and the Stonewall Stormers, Canada's Wikipedia page has no mention of wizarding sports or any other wizard activity (Wikipedia).
