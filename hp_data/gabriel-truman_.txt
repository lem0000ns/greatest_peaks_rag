Gabriel Truman is a Hufflepuff prefect. He pens the letter that is a welcome to and a history of Hufflepuff House to newly sorted students.
Gabriel Truman was the prefect Rowling created to welcome anyone who got sorted into Hufflepuff on the website once known as Pottermore. That iteration of that website no longer exists, and any writings that Rowling posted there can now be found on the Wizarding World website. However, this editor could not find any reference to Truman on the updated Wizarding World website. --EJ
