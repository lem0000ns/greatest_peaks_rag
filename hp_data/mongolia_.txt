Mongolia
Mongolia is mentioned in QA8 as a country where flying carpets are the norm and Quidditch is treated largely with “some suspicion.” Also, when Snape took over Defence Against the Dark Arts for Lupin during Harry’s third year, he ruffled through papers and criticized a student for an incorrect answer, saying that “the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia” (PA9). Though as it turns out, he was wrong – kappas are Japanese, which Harry and Ron were more than happy to point out in the margins of Harry’s copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (FB).
