Stubby Lamont was blamed for passing on undesirable physical attributes to his son Hector, the Seeker for Scotland at the 1990 Quidditch World Cup tournament (Pm).
The word stubby (English) means "short and thick". It is often given as a nickname to (mostly male) people of short stature, or in this case, to someone with short and thick fingers.... (Wikipedia).
Lamont is a Scottish surname, in use since medieval times, and comes from the Old Norse name Logmathr (log meaning "law" and mathr (mann) meaning "man") (Internet Surname Database).
