Catriona is the Gaelic form of the name Katherine. It may come from the Greek name ικατερινη (Aikaterine) / ‘Εκατερινη (Hekaterine), meaning "each of the two", or from a Coptic name meaning "my consecration of your name". Through Christianity it became associated with the Greek word καθαρος (katharos), meaning "pure" (Behind the Name).
McCormack is a Scottish surname, deriving from the pre-10th century Gaelic personal name Cormac. It has two possible meanings: corb (meaning "raven" or an earlier Celtic word "charioteer") plus mac "son of", therefore "son of the raven" or "son of the charioteer" (Internet Surname Database).
