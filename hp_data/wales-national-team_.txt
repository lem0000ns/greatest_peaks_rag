Wales National Team
The Welsh National Teams are from Wales (one of the four countries that together are the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland).
During the qualifying rounds of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup competition, the Welsh National Quidditch Team lost to a team from Uganda (GF5).
The World Cup tournament of 2014 was held in the Patagonian desert of Argentina and Wales was one of the sixteen countries to qualify for the competition (Pm).
A letter of complaint, “Gobstones Tournament Overlooked“, was sent to the Daily Prophet by Grugwyn Rufford, who was upset by the lack of coverage of the Welsh National Team’s win at gobstones over the Hungarian National side (DP1).
As a result of her antics at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup tournament (as reported by Ginny Weasley), Gwenog Jones may be imprisoned (Pm). This is not the first time Gwenog has been in trouble with the authorities (DP4).
Although Wales has played matches in more than one Quidditch World Cup, there are no wizarding sports teams mentioned on its Wikipedia page (Wikipedia).
Although the dates printed on the Daily Prophet Newsletters are:
the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
