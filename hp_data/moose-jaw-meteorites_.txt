Moose Jaw Meteorites 
The Moose Jaw Meteorites are a Quidditch team based in the city of Moose Jaw in Canada.
Considered to be one of the three “most accomplished” teams in the world, the Meteorites were threatened with being disbanded in the 1970s due to their tradition of flying over local villages shooting sparks from their brooms, a violation of the International Statute of Secrecy. They now restrict their victory celebrations to the Quidditch pitch and these colourful displays have therefore become quite the tourist attraction (QA8).
Moose Jaw, a city located in the province of Saskatchewan in Canada, has several different sports teams in its Wikipedia listing, but no Quidditch team (Wikipedia).
