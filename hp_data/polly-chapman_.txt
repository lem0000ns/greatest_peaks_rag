First Introduced CC1: Cursed Child Act 1

“... she’s a notorious beauty, after all...”
--Scorpius Malfoy (CC4.14)
Polly Chapman was an attractive, confident Hogwarts student in the same year as Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy – neither of whom she held in particularly high regard. She tended to say rather harsh – but honest – things (CC1.4, CC2.11, CC3.2, CC4.14).
Polly was one of the students who expressed surprise when Albus Potter was sorted into Slytherin CC1.4).
Polly has at least one magical parent (CC3.2).
