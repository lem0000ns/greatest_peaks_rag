An extremely influential figure in the Ministry of Magic during the late eighteenth century, during Unctuous Osbertâ€™s time in office, although Malfoy was not an elected government official. Many believe that Osbert was controlled by Malfoy during his term as Minister.
Septimus is a Roman birth-order name, indicating that the person is the seventh son. Whether Malfoy was actually the seventh son or whether he was given this name to connect to the magical properties of the number seven is unknown.
