"Beaters Pringle and Picquery will need to find better form...."
-- Ludo Bagman's assessment of the USA team in the Daily Prophet (Pm)
Pringle was a Beater for the United States National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
Along with fellow Beater Lucas Picquery, Pringle was a member of the US team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup (Pm).
Pringle participated in the matches against Jamaica (won by 240 points to 230) and Liechtenstein (won by 450 points to 290) (Pm).
The team lost a two-day match against Brazil (420 points to 310) in the semi-finals and also lost the third place playoff match against Japan (330 points to 120) (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Pringle must have been born after 1976.
Pringle is a surname of 13th Century Scottish origin from Hoppringel (an estate in Stow, Roxburghshire). It derives from Old English hop "an enclosed valley" combined with the Norse-Viking given name Prjonn and the word gil "an enclosed valley or ravine" (Internet Surname Database).
As he or she comes from the USA, Pringle could have attended the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
