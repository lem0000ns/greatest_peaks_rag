First Introduced OP31: O.W.L.s

Harold Dingle was a student at Hogwarts in the 1990s. He tried to sell what he claimed was powdered dragon claw to other students as a study aid; Hermione confiscated and destroyed them because they were really dried Doxy droppings (OP31). He also offered to sell Firewhiskey to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas.
