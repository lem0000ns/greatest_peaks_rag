First Introduced QA9: The Development of the Racing Broom

Basil Horton played for the Falmouth Falcons, a Quidditch team from England, in the 1920s. Along with his Falcons teammate Randolph Keitch, he started the Comet Trading Company in 1929. He and Randolph are also the creators of the Horton-Keitch Braking Charm (QA9).
Basil comes from the Greek name Βασιλειος (Basileios), derived from βασιλευς (basileus) meaning "king" (Behind the Name). It can also mean "brave, valiant" in Arabic (باسل) (Behind the Name).
Horton derives from Old English horh "dirt, mud" and tun "enclosure, yard, town" (Wikipedia). For many people, it also brings to mind the popular children's book by Dr Seuss "Horton Hears a Who".
