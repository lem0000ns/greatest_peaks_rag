First Introduced DH21: The Tale of the Three Brothers (chapter)

"Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him."
-- Beedle the Bard, Tale of the Three Brothers (TTB)
Death personified, wearing a black hood. In the “Tale of the Three Brothers,” he was angry that the three Peverells had cheated him by building a bridge over a raging river. But Death was cunning and patient, so he flattered them and offered gifts that would eventually lead them back his way. The three “Deathly Hallows” were the Elder Wand given to Antioch Peverell, the Resurrection Stone given to Cadmus Peverell, and Death’s own Cloak of Invisibility given to Harry Potter’s ancestor, Ignotus Peverell (TTB, DH21). Antioch died a violent death when someone stole the Elder Wand and cut his throat, and Cadmus killed himself in grief after realizing the Stone could never truly bring his lost love back to life. The only brother who managed to evade death until old age was Ignotus, owner of the Cloak that protected him. Ignotus “greeted Death as an old friend” when his time came (DH21).
