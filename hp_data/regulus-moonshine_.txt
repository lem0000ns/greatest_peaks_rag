"Most of my hag volunteers have refrained from taking a bit out of me since last Tuesday"
-- Professor Regulus Moonshine to the Daily Prophet (DP4)
Professor Moonshine is a researcher whose specialty is potions that affect hags (DP4)
He claimed, in a press-conference covered by the Daily Prophet, to have developed a potion that would decrease the hag’s natural desire for human flesh. He had several chunks of flesh missing himself, thanks to his test subjects (DP4)
Regulus is the brightest star in the constellation of Leo and means "prince" or "little king" in Latin.

Moonshine is another word for "moonlight" but is also the name used to describe a high-proof distilled spirit made with corn mash, usually produced illicitly. The word "moonshine" for alcohol is believed to be derived from the term "moonrakers" - early English smugglers who operated at night.
