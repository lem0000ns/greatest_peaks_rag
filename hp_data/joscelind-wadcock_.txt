Joscelind is likely to be a variant of Joceline or Jocelyn, which is derived German Gaut (the name of the Germanic tribe the Goths), combined with a Latin diminutive suffix (Behind the Name).
Wadcock may be a diminutive of the surname Wade (Oxford Dictionary of Family Names), which derives from Olde English wadan ("to go") or (ge)waed ("ford") (Internet Surname Database).
