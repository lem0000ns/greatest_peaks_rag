Chudley
Chudley is the home of the Chudley Cannons, Ron’s favorite Quidditch team – a team that is regularly at the bottom of the British and Irish Quidditch League standings (CS3).
Although there is no town with the name of Chudley in Britain, there is a Chudleigh located in Devon (Wikipedia) - not far from Ottery St. Catchpole and the Burrow. (Eight centuries is long enough for the spelling to drift, isn't it?)
