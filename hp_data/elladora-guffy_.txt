"I have clipped out your article and put it under Madam Guffy's door, and only hope that she will now see the error of her ways"
-- Ethelbald Mordaunt, letter to the Daily Prophet (DP1)
Elladora Guffy was the next-door neighbour of Ethelbald Mordaunt. Madam Guffy was fond of practical jokes. She was been known on occasion to enchant Mordaunt’s garden furniture. This infuriated Mr. Mordaunt, which he eloquently expressed in a letter to the Daily Prophet (DP1).
Good at charms!
