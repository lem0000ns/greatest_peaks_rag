First Introduced DH8: The Wedding

Lancelot was a cousin of Ron Weasley’s Aunt Muriel. He was a Healer at St. Mungo’s around 1900 when Ariana Dumbledore was young. He told Muriel that the Dumbledores never brought Ariana into the hospital, which naturally made Muriel suspect the worst. After all, not going to the hospital certainly suggests that someone is sick, doesn’t it (DH8).
