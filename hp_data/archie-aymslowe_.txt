Fresh Air Refreshes Totally (F.A.R.T.)


First Introduced Pm: Pottermore

Archie Aymslowe was president of the fringe movement entitled Fresh Air Refreshes Totally, or F.A.R.T. (Pm: Wizard Clothing).
This character might very well be the Archie we encounter by the water pump in the campground at the World Cup, the wizard who “likes a good healthy breeze” around his privates (GF7).
