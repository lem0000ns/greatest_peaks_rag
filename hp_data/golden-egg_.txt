Golden Egg
A heavy golden egg, made in the shape of a dragonâ€™s egg (though not the same color), is the prize for those who successfully completed the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament. The egg was made to open, whereupon it would emit a screeching sound: the voices of merfolk giving the clue for the Second Task. The voices and hence the clue could only be discerned if the egg was opened underwater (GF20).
