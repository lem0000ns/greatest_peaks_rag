First Introduced GF8: The Quidditch World Cup

"Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria’s first goal."
-- The final match of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup (GF8)
Ivanova was a Chaser on the Bulgarian National Team at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.
Along with her fellow Chasers, Levski and Dimitrov, Ivanova was a member of the Bulgarian team that lost the 1994 Quidditch World Cup final to the Irish National Team. The other members of the 1994 team were Beaters Volkov and Vulchanov, Keeper Zograf and Seeker Viktor Krum (GF8).
The tournament was overshadowed by the appearance of the Dark Mark over the campground after the match (GF9, Pm).
Ivanova is the feminine form of the very common Bulgarian surname Ivanov (meaning "son of Ivan"). It comes from Old Slavic Іѡаннъ (Ioannu) and Greek Ιωαννης (Ioannes) and is equivalent to the English name John. They are derived from the Hebrew name יוֹחָנָן (Yochanan) meaning "Yahweh is gracious" (Behind the Name). A famous Bulgarian of the same name was women's rights activist Dimitrana Ivanova (1881–1960) (Wikipedia).
