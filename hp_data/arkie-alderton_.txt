Arkie Alderton is reported to be a well-known broomstick designer (DH13).
In 1997, a man in front of the Muggle-born Registration Committee claims that
“My father was a wizard, he was, look him up, Arkie Alderton….” (DH13)
The use of past tense seems to indicate that Arkie is dead by 1997.
He is probably the current proprietor (or his namesake) of “Arkie Alderton’s Kwik-Repair Shop” for magical brooms (BLC).
It's possible Arkie is descended from Archibald Alderton, whose name he shares.
Arkie may be a diminutive of the name Archie, itself a nickname for Archibald, which is derived German ercan "genuine" and bald "bold". It is also related to the Greek αρχος (archos), meaning "master" (Behind the Name).
Alderton is a surname based on a location. There are several Aldertons - in Essex. Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire and Wiltshire. Towns in Shropshire and Suffolk have the variant name Aldertone. It may mean the tun ("town, village") by the alder wood (Internet Surname Database).
