First Introduced HPM

This last name appears in the draft of the classlist of Harry’s year that J.K. Rowling displayed during the “Harry Potter and Me” TV interview (HPM). However this student cannot be firmly considered canon since Runcorn was not included on the “Original Forty” list posted on Pottermore (Pm). Interestingly, in the seventh book, Harry uses Polyjuice Potion to impersonate a wizard named Runcorn who could be a relative to this child.
Possibly related to Albert Runcorn, a wizard on the Ministry Staff.
