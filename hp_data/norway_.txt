Norway
A beautiful Scandinavian country famous for its fjords, Norway is home to the Norwegian Ridgeback dragon (FB) and is a country where Quidditch is quite popular (QA8).
Mention of Quidditch reached Norway as early as the twelfth century, when Olaf received a letter describing it â€“ a letter which is now on display in the Norwegian Ministry of Magic (QA3). And the sport was certainly popular by the early 1400s, when Norwegian poet Ingolfr the Iambic wrote a verse about the sport (QA8).
Karasjok is also located in Norway.
