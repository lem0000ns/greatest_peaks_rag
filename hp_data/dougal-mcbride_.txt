First Introduced DP3: Daily Prophet Issue 3

"McBride.... insisted that Cotton had put a Jelly-Fingers curse on him as they both swooped down on the Snitch."
-- match report in the Daily Prophet (DP3)
Dougal McBride played Seeker for the Pride of Portree Quidditch team in the 1990s (DP3).
After a scuffle in the air, he lost the Snitch – and therefore the match – when (according to McBride) Appleby Arrows’ Seeker Gregory Cotton cursed him. McBride then turned Cotton’s head into a cabbage in retaliation. Referee Plunkett found that both Seekers were flying with illegally concealed wands. An enquiry will follow (DP3).
Accomplished at the transfiguration of a living human's head into a common vegetable type.
Dougal is a name of Scots and Irish origin, from the Gaelic name Dubhghall "dark stranger", from dubh "dark" and gall "stranger" (Behind the Name).
McBride is a surname derived from 10th century Irish Mac giolla Brighde or Scottish Mac gille Brighde, both of which mean "the son of the follower of St Bridget" (Internet Surname Database).
You get the feeling that St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries is a very busy place after a Quidditch match....
