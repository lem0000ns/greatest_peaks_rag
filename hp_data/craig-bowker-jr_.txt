“Whoa! A Potter? In Slytherin.”
-- Craig Bowker Jr. (CC1.4)
Craig Bowker Jr. was a Slytherin Hogwarts student.
Craig Bowker Jr. was surprised when the Sorting Hat placed Albus Potter in Slytherin. (CC1.4)
In an alternate reality where Scorpius is Scorpion King, Craig does Scorpius' homework for him as a demand. (CC3.4)
When Harry and Ginny try to get into the Slytherin common room to confront Albus, Craig tries to stop them, saying that it's against the school covenant for parents or professors to enter a House quarters without permission. (CC3.15)
Delphi kills Craig when he tries to warn Albus and Scorpius that the entire school is looking for them. (CC3.19)
Craig seems to be a smart student because in CC3, Scorpius makes him do his homework for him. (CC3.4)
When Cursed Child first premiered in the West End in London, people were urged to #KeeptheSecrets. However, some information got out. #JusticeforCraig trended on Twitter, and the rest of the Harry Potter fandom, who had not seen the play, wondered who in the world Craig was.
