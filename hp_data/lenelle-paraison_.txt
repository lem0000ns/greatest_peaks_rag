Lenelle Paraison is a talented Quidditch player, who played as Keeper for the Haitian National Team at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014 (Pm).
Paraison was one of only three female Keepers at the 2014 tournament. She is a formidable in front of the hoops, blocking two-thirds of Brazil’s attempted goals in the Round of 16 match despite getting her nose broken twice (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Paraison must have been born after 1976.
The name Lenelle is shared with the famous Haitian poet and playwright, Lenelle Moïse.
Paraison is a French glassblowing term meaning "gob, blob" (Linguee).
