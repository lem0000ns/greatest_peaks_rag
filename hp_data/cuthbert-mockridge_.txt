First Introduced GF7: Bagman and Crouch

Cuthbert Mockridge was Head of the Goblin Liaison Office at the Ministry of Magic. He was one of the Ministry officials present at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup Final (GF7).
He can't have kept his job for much longer after this appearance, as two years later we hear from Slughorn that Dirk Cresswell is the Head of the Goblin Liaison Office (HBP4).
