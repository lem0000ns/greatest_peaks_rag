Profession Caretaker

Apollyon Pringle was the caretaker at Hogwarts when Arthur and Molly Weasley attended (1960s), preceding Argus Filch. He punished Arthur (for being caught out at night with Molly) in a way that left permanent scars (GF31).
The name Apollyon appears in the Bible in the book of Revelations as "the angel of the bottomless pit." (Ency. Mythica).
