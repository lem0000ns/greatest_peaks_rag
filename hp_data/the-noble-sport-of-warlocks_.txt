The Noble Sport of Warlocks
The Noble Sport of Warlocks is an early guide to Quidditch.
Written in 1620, this book is a source for Kennilworthy Whisp’s book Quidditch Through the Ages, though not to the degree of Zacharias Mumps‘ work. Umfraville’s book includes a diagram of the seventeenth century pitch, and makes clear that the position of Keeper had evolved by the author’s time to the responsibilities it includes today (QA6).
