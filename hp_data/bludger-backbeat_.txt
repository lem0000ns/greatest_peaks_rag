Bludger Backbeat
Bludger Backbeat is a method of hitting the Bludger backwards, difficult to pull off with any precision but very effective for disorienting opponents, who don’t expect a Bludger to come at them in that way (QA10).
Bludger, as the word is used in Quidditch, may have derived from the English word bludgeon, meaning a "thick stick with a heavy end, used as a weapon" or "to beat (someone) repeatedly with a bludgeon or other heavy object" (Oxford English Dictionary). Alternatively, in Australian slang, a bludger is a lazy or idle person who avoids work (Oxford English Dictionary).
Although a backbeat is being used in Quidditch to illustrate that the Beaters are beating (hitting) the Bludger backwards, it is also a musical term denoting a strong accent on an unaccented beat of the bar (Oxford English Dictionary).
This move from the modern Quidditch game is described in the book Quidditch Through the Ages by Kennilworthy Whisp (QA).
