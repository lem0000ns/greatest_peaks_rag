"A furious chase between Portree Seeker Dougal McBride and Arrows Seeker Gregory Cotton ended in a skybound scuffle"
-- match report in the Daily Prophet (DP3)
Gregory Cotton played Seeker for the Appleby Arrows Quidditch team in the 1990s (DP3).
Following an airborne scuffle with Pride of Portree seeker Dougal McBride (resulting in Cotton’s winning the Snitch), his head was transfigured into a cabbage by his irate opposite number. The Referee discovered that both Seekers were carrying illegal wands. Enquiry likely to follow (DP3).
Gregory comes from the Latin name Gregorius, via Late Greek Γρηγοριος (Gregorios), which derives from γρηγορος (gregoros) meaning "watchful, alert" (Behind the Name).
Cotton is a pre-7th century Olde English surname deriving from cotum ("cottages") (Internet Surname Database).
There’s nothing like some good healthy competition, is there? Or did he curse McBride first?
