Hesphaestus Gore was one of the earliest Aurors. He served as the seventh Minister for Magic from 1752 to 1770 and put down the bloody goblin rebellion which started in 1752. He was unsympathetic to the werewolves who had joined the goblins, a stance which many feel caused further attacks later. During his office, he renovated Azkaban prison (Pm).
