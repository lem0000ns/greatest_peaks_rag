First Introduced FW: The Famous Wizard Cards

Xavier Rastrick was a famous wizard entertainer. In 1836 he vanished unexpectedly while tap dancing for a crowd of 300 in Painswick and was never seen again (FW).
Writing that Rastrick was tap dancing when he disappeared in 1836 was probably an oversight, as modern tap dance only emerged around the 1920s - almost an entire century after Rastrick's disappearance. That being said, the British Isles do have their own longstanding traditions of clog dancing. (source: Encyclopædia Britannica Online) -BB
