First Introduced CS12: The Polyjuice Potion

Penelope Clearwater was the girlfriend of Percy Weasley while at Hogwarts, though their relationship was kept a secret for quite some time. They began dating in their fifth year. She has long curly hair (CS12).
Penelope was Sorted into Ravenclaw and attended Hogwarts from1987 – 1994. She is a prefect from 1992 to 1994.
Penelope was Petrified by Slytherin's basilisk on May 8, 1993 and was cured with Mandrake potion on May 30th (CS14).
She seems to be able to appreciate the Firebolt as a first-class broomstick, and is serious enough about Quidditch to have bet Percy 10 Galleons on the1993 - 1994. Gryffindor-Ravenclaw match (PA13).
Note: Official corrections (2004) place Penelope in the same year as Percy:
Hermione Granger uses her name when she is caught by the Snatchers in DH (DH23).
Intelligence and kindness - smart girl who was deserving of the Prefect and Head Girl titles.
It is not explicitly said, but Penelope Clearwater seems to have a great interest in Quidditch.  She marvels at Harry's new Firebolt (PA13) and places a bet with Percy over the outcome of the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw match (PA13).
In The Odyssey, Penelope was the wife of Odysseus, who very cleverly managed to avoid being forced to remarry during his long absence. Consequently, the poetic sense of the name is that of a faithful, clever woman, particularly a wife -- and of a woman who is good at stringing suitors along without committing to anything.
Penelope Clearwater is played by Gemma Padley in CS.
