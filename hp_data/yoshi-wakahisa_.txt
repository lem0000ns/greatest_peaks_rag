"....the work of Chasers Ryuichi Yamaguchi, Kimiko Kurosawa and Yoshi Wakahisa should not be overlooked."
-- match report Bulgaria v Japan, Daily Prophet, 6 July 2014 (Pm)
Yoshi Wakahisa was a Chaser for Japan’s National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
The Japanese team that won their 2014 Quidditch World Cup matches against Poland and Nigeria, but then lost to Bulgaria at the semi-final stage. They won against the United States to secure third place overall (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Wakahisa must have been born after 1976.
As Wakahisa comes from Japan, he or she will have attended the Mahoutokoro Wizarding School, as all the members of the Japanese national side have done so (Pm).
Yoshi is a Japanese name with several meanings, depending on how it is written, including: 吉 (yoshi) meaning "good luck", 義 (yoshi) meaning "righteous" and 良 (yoshi) meaning "good, virtuous, respectable" (Behind the Name).
Wakahisa may derive from two Japanese words: waka (わか)(若 稚) meaning "youth, child, young" and hisa (ひさ)(飛砂) meaning "blown sand, sand drift" (Tangorin).
