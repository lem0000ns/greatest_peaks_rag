Peru
Peru is the most Quidditch-crazed country in South America, and even has an internationally acclaimed team in Tarapoto, though its national team was flattened by that of Ireland in the World Cup semifinals in 1994 (GF5).
Peru is also the natural habitat of the Peruvian Vipertooth dragon (FB), and the country from which Weasleysâ€™ Wizard Wheezes imports Instant Darkness Powder (HBP6).
