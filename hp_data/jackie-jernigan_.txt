"Welsh Chaser Jackie Jernigan scored one of the tournament’s most stunning goals...."
-- Ginny Weasley reporting in the Daily Prophet, 4 June 2014 (Pm)
Jackie Jernigan was a Chaser on the Welsh National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
A member of the Welsh team in the Quidditch World Cup 2014 tournament, Jernigan and her fellow Chasers were called "talentless hags" by Brazil's manager José Barboza. This sparked off a feud with the Welsh manager, Gwenog Jones, that dominated the coverage of the team and eventually led to physical violence (Pm).
The team won against Germany (330 points to 100) but lost to Brazil by 460 points to 300. Jernigan, however, scored "stunning goal" from fifty yards out past Brazil's Keeper Raul Almeida (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Jernigan must have been born after 1976.
Jackie is a diminutive of the name Jacqueline, which itself derives from Jacob and the Greek Ιακωβος (Iakobos) and Hebrew יַעֲקֹב (Ya'aqov). Its meaning is obscure. In the Old Testament, Jacob is the father of the twelve founders of the twelve tribes of Israel (Behind the Name).
Jernigan may be derived from the Old Breton name Iarnuuocon meaning "iron famous" (Behind the Name).
