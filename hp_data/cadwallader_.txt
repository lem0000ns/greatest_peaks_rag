First Introduced HBP19: Elf Tails

"… but now that big Hufflepuff player’s got the Quaffle from her, I can’t remember his name, it’s something like Bibble – no, Buggins –"
-- Luna Lovegood (HBP19)
Cadwallader is a burly Chaser on the Hufflepuff Quidditch team in the 1990s.
Luna Lovegood misidentifies him while commentating their match with Gryffindor. She thought his name might be Bibble or Buggins. During the match, Cadwallader scored at least two goals (HBP19).
Talented Chaser
Cadwallader is an English rendering of the Welsh name Cadwaladr, which is derived from Ancient Welsh cad "a battle", plus gwaladr "leader". The badge of Cadwaladr ap Gruffudd, a king of Gwynedd during the 7th Century, is the red dragon now on the Welsh flag (Behind the Name, Wikipedia).
This surname is shared by Eurig Cadwallader, who played Seeker for the Welsh National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup tournament (Pm). It is possible that this is the same individual or a member of his family. -BB
