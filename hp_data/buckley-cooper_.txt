First Introduced DP3: Daily Prophet Issue 3

"....which last week culminated in him sending me a broomstick which has been cursed to whack me around the shins"
-- Buckley Cooper (DP3)
Buckley Cooper was a wizard who wrote a letter to the Daily Prophet asking for legal advice on the running feud he’d been having with his brother (DP3)
Cooper wonders whether the Ministry would "turn a blind eye" if he kidnapped his brother's children and turned them into blood-sucking ferrets. In his response, Dempster Wiggleworth of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement strongly advised against it (DP3)
While the date printed on DP3 is 1 June 1999, the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
