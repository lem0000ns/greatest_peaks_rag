First Introduced CC3: Cursed Child Act 3

"She didn’t like me much. Euphemia Rowle... she only took me in for the gold."
-- Delphi (CC3.16)
Euphemia Rowle was an “extreme Death Eater” and the guardian of Delphi, the offspring of Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange (CC3.16).
Kept a pet Augurey in a cage.
Possible relative of Thorfinn Rowle, one of Voldemort's Death Eaters (DH9).
Interestingly has the same first name as Harry's grandmother, Euphemia Potter, wife of Fleamont Potter (Pm). The shared name hints at a common relative or ancestor, which is possible because they were all Pure-bloods.
