Japan
Japan is the one country in the Far East in which Quidditch has gained widespread popularity, with the popular Tengu of Toyohashi leading the way, although the national team’s practice of setting fire to its brooms after a loss doesn’t go over well with the rest of the world (QA8).
Japan is also the native habitat of the kappa (FB).
The Wizarding school of Mahoutokoro is located in Japan (Pm).
