"I’d personally stopped him strangling two referees. However, I had no suspicion about what he was planning to do...."
-- Ivan Popa's testimony to the Enquiry following the disaster (Pm)
Ivan Popa was a Quidditch player on the Romanian National Team (1809) and a holder of the International Wizarding Order of Merit (Pm).
Popa’s teammate Niko Nenad was the cause of a disaster at the 1809 Quidditch World Cup 1809 tournament.
With Romania losing, Nenad set off the forest in a rampaging attack known to history as the “Attack of the Killer Forest“. Popa saved the day, later testifying that Nenad had been acting strangely for some time. He won International Wizarding Order of Merit for his efforts to save lives during the seven-hour battle with the trees (Pm).
Brave, fearless
Ivan is a form of John, deriving from the old Slavic name Іѡаннъ (Ioannu) and Hebrew יוֹחָנָן (Yochanan), meaning "Yahweh is gracious" (Behind the Name).
