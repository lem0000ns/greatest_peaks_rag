"[Smackhammer] risked collision with hefty Liechtenstein Chaser Willi Wenzel to tweak the Snitch"
-- match report USA v Liechtenstein, Daily Prophet, 8 June 2014 (Pm)
Willi Wenzel was a Chaser for Liechtenstein’s National Team at the Quidditch World Cup tournament held in 2014.
During the 2014 tournament, Wenzel was celebrated for taking two Bludgers to the head during Liechtenstein’s three-day match against Chad while still being able to score a goal from sixty yards away (Pm).
It was unfortunate that the US team’s Seeker caught the Snitch millimetres away from Wenzel’s ankle in their quarter-final match, which they lost by 450 points to 290. Exuberant American fans kidnapped the Liechtenstein team mascot, Hans the Augurey, during the ensuing celebrations – causing an international incident (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Wenzel must have been born after 1976.
Willi is short for Wilhelm, deriving from the Germanic name Willahelm (wil "will, desire" and helm "helmet, protection") (Behind the Name).
Wenzel is usually a first name of German and Czech origin meaning "praised with glory" (Wikipedia). Two Olympic athletes from Liechtenstein with the same surname are Andreas Wenzel and Hanni Wenzel.
