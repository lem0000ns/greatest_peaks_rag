Wimbourne Wasps
"He was a great Beater.... the Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them."
-- Ron Weasley about Ludo Bagman (GF9)
The Wimbourne Wasps are an English Quidditch team from Wimbourne in Dorset, founded in 1312 (QA7).

The Wasps took their name from an incident that occurred during a match against their traditional rivals, the Appleby Arrows, in the mid-seventeenth century. A Beater flying past a tree on the edge of the pitch noticed a wasps’ nest among the branches and batted it towards the Arrows’ Seeker, who was so badly stung that he had to retire from the game (QA7).
Their fans call themselves the “Stingers” and buzz loudly to distract opposing Chasers taking penalties (QA7).
The match against the Holyhead Harpies, which took place on Exmoor, was subject to a Ministry of Magic Masking Fog ten minutes before the start of the game. The Wasps won against the Harpies, 150-300 (DP2).
There is not a place called "Wimbourne" in Britain, only the similarly spelled town of Wimborne Minster, which is in Dorset. It has a football and a rugby team listed in its Wikipedia entry, but no Quidditch team (Wikipedia).
