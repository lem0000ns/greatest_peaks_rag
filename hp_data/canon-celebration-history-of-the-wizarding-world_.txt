One of the things that readers fall in love with about the books is the depth of information we are given – information that is often only peripheral to the plot, but nevertheless enriches our understanding of the magical world. Some of the more interesting tidbits pertain to the history of this world, the nooks and crannies of which we will explore in depth below.

Most of the artwork we have in our collection depicts the events in the Harry Potter novels. But there are a few pieces which illustrate more unusual moments in wizarding history. Here are a few examples:
Creaothceann (a broom game featuring cauldrons and flying rocks) (QA2)
Wendelin the Weird, a medieval witch who enjoyed being burned at the stake (PA1, FW)
The Potter family history – from Linfred of Stinchcombe to Harry Potter (WW)
Our Artwork Challenge for all you fan artists out there is to bring to life historical events, places and figures, such as the following:

Goblin rebellions took place in the mid-1600s and 1700s. All the bits of information in various sources fit together to tell a compelling story.
Thanks to Hermione and her wide-ranging reading habits, we find out that
“In ‘Sites of Historical Sorcery’ it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion”
— Hermione about the wizarding village of Hogsmeade (PA5)
Somehow, in plain sight, the goblins are able to conspire and run their rebellions inside a pub also frequented by wizards.
N.B. It isn’t entirely clear, however, whether the book is talking about the Three Broomsticks or the Hog’s Head – they are both referred to as an “inn” in the novels, Hermione doesn’t specify and, sadly, we don’t have the above referenced book to check. Goblins probably drink in both taverns, but the Hog’s Head has the more dodgy reputation of the two. And, of course, Hagrid bought a three-headed dog from one of the “funny folk” who drink there (PS16), the pub was used for the illegal first meeting of Dumbledore’s Army (OP16), it was a meeting place for Voldemort’s followers (HBP20) and the owner helped students trapped in the school when Hogwarts was under Death Eater control (DH29) – so its history as a place used for dubious purposes continued. But, perhaps the Three Broomsticks was a less salubrious venue in the 17th and 18th centuries than it is in modern times.
In one of her essays for the original Pottermore website, J K Rowling’s list of historical Ministers for Magic includes:

Albert Boot, the Minister for Magic from 1747-1752, was ineffective at dealing with the goblin rebellions and removed after only a few years in office (MoM, PmP).
His successor, Basil Flack, only lasted two months in 1752, resigning after the werewolves joined the goblins in the rebellion (MoM, PmP).
Finally, Hesphaestus Gore became Minister for Magic that same year. He was an Auror, and using his enforcement experience to quash the goblin rebellions was successful – although there is some about his legacy (MoM, PmP).
From one of the W.O.M.B.A.T. tests on J K Rowling’s original website we learn that in 1762 the goblin rebel leader Vargot was killed in battle. After his death, with Minister Gore firmly in charge, it seems that the goblin rebellions died down (JKR-W3).
Goblin rights, however, are still disputed within the wizarding world and wish for possession of a wand by goblins is still a very sore bone of contention. Riots organised by the Brotherhood of Goblins (B.O.G.) take place in the 1990s (DP3).
