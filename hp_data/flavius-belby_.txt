First Introduced FW: The Famous Wizard Cards

I knew that I was about to lose consciousness completely as I suffocated. Desperately, I mustered up my last reserve of energy. Pointing my wand away from myself into the deadly folds of the creature, summoning the memory of the day I had been voted President of the local Gobstones Club, I performed the Patronus Charm. Almost at once I felt fresh air upon my face. I looked up to see that deathly shadow being thrown into the air upon the horns of my Patronus. It flew across the room and slithered swiftly out of sight.

Flavius Belby survived a Lethifold attack while in Papua New Guinea in 1782. He wrote about the experience, revealing for the first time the existence of this terrible creature and also the fact that a Patronus Charm will drive a Lethifold away. Belby had at one time been voted the president of the local Gobstones Club (FB). He appears on a Famous Wizard card (FW).
Possibly related to Damocles Belby and his brother, father of Ravenclaw student Marcus Belby, a member of the Slug Club.
Survived a Lethifold attack and lived to tell about it.
