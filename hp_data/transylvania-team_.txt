Transylvania National Team
"[England] ....went down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten. Shocking performance."
-- Charlie Weasley (GF5)
The Transylvanian National Teams come from the Eastern European country of Transylvania.
The first Quidditch World Cup final was held in 1473 between Transylvania and Flanders (QA8, Pm).
A notice appeared in the Match Information section of the Daily Prophet that the Department of Magical Games and Sports were selling tickets for a friendly match between the Scottish National Team and Transylvania’s second team (DP2).
During the qualifying rounds in the run-up to the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, the England side lost to Transylvania by an embarrassing score of 390 points to England’s mere 10 (GF5).
The country of Transylvania is now a part of Romania, although they field separate teams from the Romanian National Team.
There are not any Quidditch or other wizarding sports teams mentioned on Transylvania's Wikipedia entry (Wikipedia), although Quidditch is acknowledged in the country's Culture section under "books" (Wikipedia).
Although the date printed on the second Daily Prophet Newsletter (DP2) is 8 February 1999, the timeframe for this event is 1992-1993.
