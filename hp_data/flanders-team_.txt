Flanders National Team
The Flemish National Teams come from the European country of Flanders. This is located in present-day Belgium.
The very first ever Quidditch World Cup final took place in 1473, between the European teams of Transylvania and Flanders (QA8, Pm). During this very violent match all 700 known ways of committing a Quidditch foul were recorded (PS11, QA6).
Flanders is located in Northern Belgium. Although it has been playing Quidditch since at least 1473, there is no mention of Quidditch or any other wizarding sport on its Wikipedia entry (Wikipedia).
It is not specified whether the modern teams are still fielded as Flanders or if they have combined with the South of the country and formed Belgian National Teams.
