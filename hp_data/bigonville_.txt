Bigonville
Bigonville is a small city in western Luxembourg, not far from the border with Belgium. The Bigonville Bombers, a Quidditch team known for high scoring, presumably make their home here (QA8).
Luxembourg is described as a "strong Quidditch nation" (QA8).  As it is such a small country, however, the Bigonville Bombers Quidditch team may possibly provide many of the players for Luxembourg's National Team.
