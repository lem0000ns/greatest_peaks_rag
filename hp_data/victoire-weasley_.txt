First Introduced DH/e: Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later

Victoire is the daughter of Bill and Fleur Weasley.
Harry’s son, James, caught Victoire snogging Teddy Lupin on Platform 9 ¾ as she was preparing to leave for what was most likely her seventh year at Hogwarts; at the time she would probably have been seventeen, and Teddy nineteen (DH/e). She was born on May 2nd, the anniversary of the victory over Voldemort (YL).
Mother: Fleur Delacour
Father: Bill Weasley
Siblings: Dominique Weasley and Louis Weasley.
The Quidditch World Cup in 2014 is years before the Epilogue. Already, Teddy and Victoire were snogging, as Rita Skeeter put it. How come Harry's son James did not notice this before?
