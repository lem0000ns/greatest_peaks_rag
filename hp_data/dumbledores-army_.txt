Dumbledore's Army
Dumbledore’s Army was a student group formed in 1995 by Hermione Granger and led by Harry Potter. The group trained in using offensive and defensive magic to prepare for a potential battle with Voldemort and his supporters. Dumbledore’s Army, also known as the D.A., was created in response to the Ministry removing all practical experience with offensive and defensive magic from the curriculum at Hogwarts.
