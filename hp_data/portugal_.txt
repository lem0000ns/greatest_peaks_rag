Portugal
A small country in southwest Europe bordered only by Spain, Portugal is home to the Portuguese Long-Snout dragon. Though not mentioned in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a sketch of the Portuguese Long-Snout can be found in the pages of Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit, the pages of which are sketched in a hidden page on Rowlingâ€™s website. Drawn along with the Catalonian Fireball, the Long-Snout brings the total number of known dragon species to twelve.
