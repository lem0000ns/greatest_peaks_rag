WALES VERSUS GERMANY
-- headline, Daily Prophet, 22 May 2014 (QWC)
The ever-controversial manager of the Welsh National Team, Gwenog Jones, said she was “bloody delighted” to have won their match against Germany by a score of 330 points to 100, after hearing that the severely injured German Seeker, Thorsten Pfeffer was going to recover. He was lured by a Wronski Feint into an extremely steep dive and failed to pull out in time. Skele-Gro was successfully administered at the scene (QWC).
