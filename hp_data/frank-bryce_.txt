's far as I'm concerned, he killed them, and I don't care what the police say. And if he had any decency, he'd leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.
--Dot (GF1)
Frank Bryce was the elderly muggle caretaker of the Riddle house in Little Hangleton. He was killed by Voldemort (GF1). He was a resident of Little Hangleton for most of his life, except for his military service during World War II (in which he was wounded, leaving him with a certain amount of permanent disability). After the war he worked for the Riddle family as a gardener; he was 28 at time of their deaths (GF1). Bryce was initially blamed for the Riddle killings, but cleared of the charges. He continued to look after the house for fifty years until Voldemort returned and murdered him (GF1).
Months later, in the Little Hangleton graveyard,  Frank’s shade came out of Voldemort’s wand during the duel between Harry and Voldemort (GF34) and egged Harry on, now believing that Voldemort really is a wizard.
