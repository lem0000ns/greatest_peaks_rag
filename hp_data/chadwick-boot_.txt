First Introduced MNA: Magic in North America (essays)

Chadwick Boot, spellbook author and one of the founders of Ilvermorney wizarding school, was the elder son of wizard parents who foolishly wandered into the wilds of 17th century America and were killed by a Hidebehind. He and his younger brother Webster were rescued by Isolt Sayre, who taught them magic and eventually adopted them with husband James Steward. Chadwick took part in founding Ilvermony and founded the house Thunderbird. He later wrote Chadwick’s Charms Vols I – VII which is used at Ilvermony.
