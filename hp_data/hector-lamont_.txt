Hector Lamont was the Seeker for the 1990 Quidditch World Cup team from Scotland. He blamed his father “Stubby” Lamont for his failure to catch the Snitch during the final match against Canada (Pm).
The name Hector comes from the Latin form of Greek ‘Εκτωρ (Hektor), meaning "holding fast". In Greek legend, Hector was a Trojan champion (Behind the Name).
Lamont is a medieval surname of Scottish origin, derived from the pre-Seventh Century Old Norse name Logmathr (from log meaning "law" and mathr (mann) meaning "man") (Internet Surname Database).
In 1994, Scotland's National Team lost to Luxembourg in the run up to that year's Quidditch World Cup. It is not known whether Lamont was given a second chance to make up for their loss in the 1990 final (GF5).
