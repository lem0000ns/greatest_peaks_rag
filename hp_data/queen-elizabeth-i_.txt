Queen Elizabeth I was the Muggle Queen of England and Ireland, from November 1558 until her death in March 1603. Known as the Virgin Queen, she was the last Tudor monarch. Her reign was known as the Elizabethan period.
Magical historians have suggested that she never married due to a jinx placed on her by Lucius Malfoy I, whom she rejected as a suitor (Pm).
