First Introduced CS8: The Deathday Party

The ghost of a ragged man wearing chains attended the Deathday party of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington on Oct. 31, 1992 (CS8) This ragged man is — or rather was — a wizard (OP38).
This ghost in chains could be Jacob Marley, the ghost of Ebenezer Scrooge's dead partner, from Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Thanks to Mike Ball for this suggestion.
