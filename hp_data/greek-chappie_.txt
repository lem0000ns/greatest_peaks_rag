A “Greek chappie” is how Hagrid describes the man who sold him Fluffy, the three-headed dog, while having a drink at the Hog’s Head pub in Hogsmeade (PS11).
He had managed to capture a rare three-headed dog.
chappie is informal British usage for a chap, meaning a man or boy. It derives from the English word chapman (a "pedlar") (Oxford English Dictionary (1) (2).

Of course, it has to be someone from Greece to be able to catch a mythical Greek dog from the underworld.
