Quidditch pitch
"Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch pitch at seven o’clock for your first training session."
-- note received by Harry (PS10)
The Quidditch pitch is an oval-shaped area (the pitch) (US: “field of play”) where Quidditch matches are held. It is 500 feet long by 180 feet wide (QA6). Modern Quidditch pitches are usually located inside Quidditch stadiums – there are several in England, one at Hogwarts and an unknown number worldwide.
