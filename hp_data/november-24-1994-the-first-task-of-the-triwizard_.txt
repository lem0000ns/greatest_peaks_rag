GF20: The First Task

 Type of Event Wizarding world 
The champions take it in turn to try to steal a golden egg from the clutches of a different kind of dragon. Harry summons his broom to help him get the egg from his dragon a Hungarian Horntail, and he completes the task in the shortest amount of time.
Before Harryâ€™s go, Cedric faces a Swedish Short-Snout, Fleur goes up against a Welsh Green, and Viktor confronts a Chinese Fireball.
Fleur tries to put her dragon into some sort of enchanted sleep. Krum tries the Conjunctivitis Curse the first task, but the dragon goes into such violent convulsions that she smashes some of her own eggs.
The action of the chapter takes place from the morning of 22 November through the afternoon of the 24th, when the First Task takes place. The dates of the week given in the chapter are consistent with Hallowe'en having been a Saturday.
This task strongly resembles the third and final task assigned to Jason in Greek mythology: when he has to get the golden fleece, which is being guarded by a dragon/serpent in a grove.
