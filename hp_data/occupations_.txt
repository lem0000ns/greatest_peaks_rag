Occupations
Witches and wizards hold a variety of jobs, some of them very similar to Muggle jobs but others very unique to the Wizarding world (such as Dragon keeper). Some Wizarding jobs are a lot more exciting than their Muggle counterparts. For example, being a banker in the Wizarding world could mean breaking into ancient tombs and dispelling the curses placed on things thousands of years ago.
