Profession Minister for Magic
First Introduced Pm: Pottermore

Archer Evermonde was Minister for Magic during World War I, serving  1912 – 1923.
In accordance with the International Statute of Secrecy, Evermonde passed laws to keep wizards from being involved with WWI, but of course many disobeyed his orders and helped Muggles.
A combination of the English word "ever" = always with the French word for "world" = "monde" Could be a reference to the Marquis St. Evremonde, a cruel Parisian aristocrat in Charles Dickens' novel A Tale of Two Cities. The word "monde" (world) could also be ironic: Evermonde was Minister for Magic during World War I, yet believed the Wizarding World shouldn't interfere.
