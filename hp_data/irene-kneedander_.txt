Profession Head of the Body for Protection of Magical Species (Humanoid)
First Introduced Pm: Pottermore

Irene Kneedander was Head of the Body for Protection of Magical Species (Humanoid) for MACUSA is 1892. In this role, she seriously cracked down on Sasquatches who “stepped out of line.” She and her treatment of Sasquatches are considered responsible for the Great Sasquatch Rebellion of 1892 (Pm).
Perhaps ironically, Irene is derived from a Greek word meaning "peace" (source: Behind the Name).
