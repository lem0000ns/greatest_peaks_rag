Black Forest
Shortly after Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys travelled via Portkey to the Quidditch World Cup, Basil told them that they needed to move out of the way because a big party would arrive from the Black Forest in a few minutes (GF7). This party was travelling via Portkey, then, from Germany â€“ where the Black Forest has for centuries been a haven for vacationing nobility and working artists and writers.
The Black Forest is also home to Ellerby and Spudmore, a broom company that produces the Tinderblast and the Swiftstick (QA9), as well as the natural habitat of the Erkling (FB).
