"Right pair of jokers, aren’t you?"
-- P.C. Anderson, about to have a very unusual evening (Pre)
Police Constable Anderson was a Muggle police officer who detained two suspicious young men on a rather peculiar motorcycle. Anderson and his partner, Sergeant Fisher, were astonished to see what appeared to be two men flying on brooms, their squad car rise up into the air of its own accord, and the motorcycle with it’s riders fly away into the night. But that can’t have happened, can it?
