Cleansweep Broom Company
"Just caught her! She says she'll get the Cleansweep if she can."
-- Ron Weasley (OP9)
The Cleansweep Broom Company, started in 1926 by Bob, Bill and Barnaby Ollerton, produces a series of sport broomsticks.
The Ollerton brothers produced large numbers of Cleansweeps aimed specifically at the racing and Quidditch markets. Models released by the company include: Cleansweep 1, Cleansweep 2, Cleansweep 3, Cleansweep 5, Cleansweep 6, Cleansweep 7 and Cleansweep 11 (QA9, CS7, OP9).
The Cleansweep series are known for their ability to turn corners quickly and efficiently (QA9).
