Sweden

Â 
A beautiful country in northern Europe and part of Scandinavia, Sweden is well-known for having one of the highest standards of living in the world. It is the natural habitat of the Swedish Short Snout Dragon (including at least one Reservation), and home of a world-famous annual broom race from Kopparberg to Arjeplog (QA2).
Luna Lovegood and her father, Xeno, also took a trip to Sweden in the summer of 1996 to search for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack, a creature that, well, may or may not exist (OP38).
