Wizards’ Council
The Wizards’ Council was one of several bodies which governed the British magical community before the creation of the Ministry of Magic in 1707 (FB, MoM). It was also referred to as the “Warlock’s Council” (FW, WotM). The leader of the Council was called the Chief (QA4) or, if a witch, the Chieftainess (FW, WotM).
