Hello, I'm Corinne (she/her). I'm from Michigan, but I reside in Illinois (near Chicago). I studied English at school, so I'm really into reading and writing. I'm a lifelong Harry Potter fan who strives to be a walking encyclopedia for all things HP! I'm a big nerd and fitness gal. You'll probably find me reading or gaming in my free time.
