First Introduced Pm: Pottermore

Father of Dolores Umbridge, Orford was an unambitious man who worked for many years in Magical Maintenance at the Ministry of Magic Headquarters. Umbridge was unhappily married for over fifteen years to a Muggle, Ellen Cracknell. They had two children, their older a daughter, Dolores, and the younger a squib son. Eventually, Ellen took her son and went back into the Muggle world. Orford retired from the Ministry and his daughter, who now pretended to be a pure-blood child of a famous member of the Wizengamot, pretended he didn’t exist (Pm).
