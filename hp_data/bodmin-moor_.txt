Bodmin Moor
Bodmin Moor is located in Cornwall at the southwestern tip of England. It is a historical farming region that also features a Quidditch stadium, where several matches of the British and Irish Quidditch League have been held (DP2, DP3, DP4).
It is the location of the famous match of 1884 in which a Snitch escaped after eluding capture by the Seekers for six months of play. The Snitch is said to be living wild on the moor still (QA6).
Located in the Eastern section of Cornwall, near Devon, nearly all of the land on Bodmin Moor is privately owned. One might guess that the area used for the Quidditch pitch is on the property of a Witch or Wizard.
It is also the home of the legendary "Beast of Bodmin", who may be just a convenient myth invented by the Wizarding community to scare Muggles away from the area (Cornwall Guide).
Although the dates printed on the Daily Prophet Newsletters are:
the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
