Profession Merchant
First Introduced GF7: Bagman and Crouch

Ali Bashir was a flying carpet merchant who was very interested in importing flying carpets into Britain. Arthur Weasley wouldnâ€™t allow it, so Ali tried to smuggle carpets in (GF7, GF23).
Ali's mention serves as an opening for Crouch to emphasize that his family members were law-abiding (his grandfather's Axminster). This is important, considering Crouch Jr., and the various laws Crouch Sr. himself broke to acquire and maintain his son's freedom.
