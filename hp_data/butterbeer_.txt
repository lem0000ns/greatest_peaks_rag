Butterbeer
"... when Winky has been very drunk, he has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to Butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off, sir ..."
-- Dobby (OP18)
Butterbeer is a very popular drink in the Wizarding world. It is served both hot and cold, on draft in pubs like the Three Broomsticks and bottled as well.
After the Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince there was some controversy over Emma Watson's performance post-Butterbeer drinking and whether or not it was strong enough to get you drunk, however there was no evidence in the books that people could get drunk off drinking Butterbeer.
How is butterbeer made and what does it taste like? When asked about this by "Bon Appetit" magazine (January 2002), JKR responded: "I made it up. I imagine it to taste a little bit like less-sickly butterscotch."
