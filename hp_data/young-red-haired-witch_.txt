First Introduced CG: The Crimes of Grindelwald

In early September of 1927, a young red-haired witch attended Grindelwald‘s rally. During Grindlewald’s speech she turned to attack an Auror who stood behind her after Grindelwald’s words enraged her at the Auror’s presence. Before she could curse him the young Auror struck first and killed her. Grindelwald descended into the crowd, knelt and lifted the witch’s limp body in his arms. He told his followers to apparate her body away. (CG)
