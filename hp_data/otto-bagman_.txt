First Introduced GF5: Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes

Otto Bagman was a wizard who got into trouble with the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office because of an unusual lawnmower which Arthur Weasley straightened out for him. Out of gratitude, Otto’s brother Ludo then arranged the Weasleys’ tickets to the Quidditch World Cup (GF5).
