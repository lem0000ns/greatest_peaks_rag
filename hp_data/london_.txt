London
"Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy all yer stuff fer school."
-- Rubeus Hagrid (PS5)
Located in southeastern England, London is one of the largest and most famous cities in the world. For Muggles, it is the center of British commerce and government, and for wizards and witches things are no different. We know of more wizarding places in London than anywhere else in Britain, and after Hogwarts and Privet Drive, it is the place where Harry spends the most time.

The film version of the first book has led many to mistakenly believe that Harry's encounter with the boa constrictor took place at the London Zoo. This isn't correct, however, since according to the book, Harry had never visited London before he went there with Hagrid to buy his things for Hogwarts, which was a month later:
"Can we buy all this in London?" Harry wondered aloud.
"If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid.
Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow (PS5).
