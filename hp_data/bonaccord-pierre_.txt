Profession Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards

Pierre Bonaccord was the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, a position later held by none other than Albus Dumbledore. Bonaccord wanted to ban troll-hunting and grant trolls rights, possibly full “being” status, but since a tribe of Mountain Trolls had been causing a lot of trouble in Liechtenstein, their wizarding community contested Bonaccord’s appointment, and refused to join the Confederation as a result (OP31).
"Bon" = French for "good" + "accord" = harmony or reconciliation.
