Profession Author
First Introduced FW: The Famous Wizard Cards

Beatrix Bloxam was the author of The Toadstool Tales series of children’s books. These books have been banned because they cause nausea and vomiting. Bloxam appears on a Famous Wizard card (FW) and is mentioned several times in Tales of Beedle the Bard (TBB).
Bloxam’s stated ideas for children’s stories were “filling the pure minds of our little angels with healthy, happy thoughts, keeping their sweet slumber free of wicked dreams and protecting the precious flower of their innocence”.
Very possibly this is a reference to Beatrix Potter.
Please note that there appeared to be a discrepancy between the image of Bloxam on the card (as an elderly lady) and her birth and death dates on the FW card -- 1794-1810 -- which indicated that she died at the age of 16. This error was corrected in Tales of Beedle the Bard. (TBB/WHH)
