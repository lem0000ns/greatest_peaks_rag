Pakistan
Sandwiched along the Indian Ocean between Iran, Afghanistan, and India, Pakistan is a densely populated, largely Muslim country with both mountains and hundreds of miles of coastline. It is one of several countries in this region of the world that prefer flying carpets to brooms, and so where Quidditch is less popular than in the rest of the wizarding world (QA8).
