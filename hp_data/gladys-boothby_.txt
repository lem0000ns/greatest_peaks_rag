First Introduced QA9: The Development of the Racing Broom

Gladys Boothby created the Moontrimmer racing broom in 1901, but was unable to keep up with commercial demand for it by Quidditch enthusiasts who wanted the broom’s new height-flying features (QA9).
Gladys comes from the old Welsh name Gwladus, derived from gwlad ("country"). The Welsh name can be translated into English as the given name Claudia (Behind the Name).
Boothby is a English surname of Norse-Viking origin, after villages in Lincolnshire. It means "the farm with the stables" and is pre-8th century (Internet Surname Database).
