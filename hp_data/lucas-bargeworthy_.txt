First Introduced QWC: The Quidditch World Cup (essays)

Lucas Bargeworthy was a Beater for the England National Team in 1870s.
Bargeworthy was a participant in the mysterious 1877 Quidditch World Cup tournament held in Kazakhstan. Retaining no recollection of any of the events of the so-called “Tournament that Nobody Remembers“, he was missing most of his teeth when he returned to consciousness (QWC).
Lucas is an English form of the Greek name Λουκας (Loukas) which meant "from Lucania", a region of southern Italy (Behind the Name).
Bargeworthy is a surname that has probably been constructed from the words barge (meaning "a flat bottomed boat" or "to move forcefully or roughly") and worthy (meaning "having qualities deserving regard" or, conversely, "good intent, but lacking in humour").
It isn't known whether, following the traumatic events of 1877, Lucas Bargeworthy decided to attend the re-staged Quidditch World Cup tournament the following year.
