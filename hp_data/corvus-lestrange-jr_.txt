First Introduced CG: The Crimes of Grindelwald

Corvus Lestrange Jr (aka Corvus Lestrange V) was a French wizard and a member of the pure-blood Lestrange family. He was the son of Corvus Lestrange and Clarisse Tremblay (CGf). He died as an infant when the ship carrying him and his half-sister, Leta, to America sank in the Atlantic Ocean. Leta Lestrange swapped Corvus with another child because she said she didnâ€™t want to hear him cry anymore (CG)
"Corvus" is Latin for "raven" and the family name (Corvidae) of black birds including crows, ravens, rooks and jackdaws.
