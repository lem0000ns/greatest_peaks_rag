-- Howland Coopey (DP3)
Howland Coopey was a wizard whose letter was published on the Problem Page of the Daily Prophet (DP3)
In his letter to the Daily Prophet's Problem Page entitled "I'm Turning Purple" asking for medical advice, Mr Coopey described his distressing symptoms and wondered if they were anything to be concerned about. Professor Spleen responded that it was a simple case of Dragon Pox (DP3)
Mr Coopey isn't told that there is a cure available for Dragon Pox (FW) or that people can die from it (HBP9, Pm)
While the date printed on DP3 is 1 June 1999, the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
