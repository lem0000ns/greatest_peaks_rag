"Dennis Moon was sent off in the 106th minute."
-- match report Bulgaria v New Zealand, Daily Prophet, 20 May 2014 (Pm)
Dennis Moon was a Chaser for the New Zealand National Team at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014.
During their initial match at the 2014 tournament, Moon collided with Bulgarian Chaser Bogomil Levski, with whom he had a long-standing feud. Referee Georgios Xenakis deemed the collision deliberate, and sent Moon off for blatching.  This was deemed a crucial factor in New Zealand’s subsequent loss and exit from the competition (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Moon must have been born after 1976.
Dennis (also Denys or Denis) is a form of the Greek name Dionysos or Dionysius, derived from Διος (Dios) "of Zeus" and Nysa (the region where he was raised). In Greek mythology he is the god of wine, revelry, fertility and dance (Behind the Name).
Moon as a surname has several possible sources, including from the village of Moyon in Normandy, France, the French word moun "a monk", the Old Gaelic word word moch "early" (Internet Surname Database) or the Korean surname mun (문, 文) "literature, culture, writing" (Behind the Name).
