"Todoroki, an undersung hero of the Japanese side who was on superb form...."
-- Ginny Weasley reporting in the Daily Prophet, 9 July 2014 (Pm)
Todoroki was the Keeper for the Japanese Quidditch Team at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014 (Pm).
An unsung participant in the 2014 tournament, Todoroki’s skill at saving goals passed by almost unnoticed in the tournament, as he or she was a member of such an outstanding Quidditch team (Pm).
Japan won their match of 16 round against Poland and the quarter-final fixture against Nigeria. However, they lost to Bulgaria at the semi-final stage. The Japanese won against the United States to secure third place overall (Pm).
a brilliant Keeper
Since Viktor Krum, born around 1976-77, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Todoroki must have been born after 1976.
As Todoroki comes from Japan, he or she will have attended the Mahoutokoro Wizarding School, as all the members of the Japanese national side are said to have done so (Pm).
Todoroki (とどろき)(轟き) is a Japanese surname meaning "roar, rumble, pounding, throbbing" (Tangorin).
