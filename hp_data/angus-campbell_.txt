Angus Campbell is a Chaser for the Montrose Magpies Quidditch team in the 1990s.
Hired as the replacement Chaser (after the manager of the Magpies fired Alasdair Maddock), Campbell scored seven goals against the Caerphilly Catapults in his first game for the team. Who needs that Mugglemanic Maddock anyway? (DP3)
Angus is the English form of the Gaelic name Aonghus, meaning "one strength" (óen "one" and gus "force, strength, energy") (Behind the Name).
Campbell is a Gaelic surname deriving from cam béul meaning "wry or crooked mouth". It may also derive from Latin de bello campo meaning "of the beautiful field" (Internet Surname Database).
