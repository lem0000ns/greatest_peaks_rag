Dorcas is the name of a shepherdess in Shakespeare's "A Winter's Tale."
A woman in the New Testament of the Bible was named Dorcas (Greek) or "Tabitha" (Aramaic). She was renowned for being generous to the poor and widows by giving them clothing, and is still revered as a saint by some Christian denominatons. When she died, the story goes that St. Peter raised her from the dead. In the last century, it was common for small towns to have "Dorcas Societies" that would provide charity to the poor.
