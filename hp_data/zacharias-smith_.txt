First Introduced OP16: In the Hog’s Head

Zacharias Smith is a student in Hufflepuff House during the 1990s. He’s a real winner of a guy who seems to offend people every time he speaks.
He was a Chaser on the Hufflepuff Quidditch team from at least 1995 (OP16, OP26). Zacharias joined Dumbledore’s Army after overhearing Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott talking about it, and was immediately a constant skeptic, not shutting up until Fred and George Weasley threaten him with a “long and lethal-looking metal instrument” (OP16) and Harry pointed out that Expelliarmus, a spell Zacharias scoffed at, had saved his life while dueling with Voldemort (OP18).
A year later, he was hardly a year wiser, pestering Ginny Weasley for details about the Department of Mysteries until she got fed up and nailed him with a Bat-Bogey Hex (HBP7). Zacharias also commentated for a Quidditch match that year, making the Gryffindors so mad that the moment the match ended, Ginny barrelled straight into him on her broom (HBP14). He particularly annoyed Ron, leading Hermione to choose between him and Cormac McLaggen to go with to Slughorn’s Christmas party, on the basis of who would annoy Ron the most. Finally, Zacharias ended his illustrious Hogwarts career in style by not only being the only D.A. member not to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, but by beating down first years to be the first one out when the school was evacuated (DH31).
Zacharias is the same name as "Zechariah", who was a minor prophet of the Old Testament, author of the Book of Zechariah.
