Quodpot
"The US has historically put up a poor show in international Quidditch, being the only country to have embraced the (frankly odd) game of Quodpot."
-- Ginny Weasley, Daily Prophet, 2014 Quidditch World Cup (Pm)
Quodpot is an American broom game variant of Quidditch invented by Abraham Peasegood. It has eleven players per side and an exploding leather ball called the Quod (QA8, Pm).
The aim of each team is to move the Quod to a pot on the opposite side of the pitch, which earns them a point. The pot contains Peasegood’s invention, Quodpot solution, which stops the Quod from exploding. If the Quod explodes while in their possession, that player must leave the field (QA8). Does the game end when only one wizard is left?
Originally, Peasegood had hoped to bring the game of Quidditch to the United States, but the Quaffle he was importing blew up in his trunk (QA8). He apparently enjoyed this sensation - so he and friends developed a new game with an explosive "feature".
Many sports and games popular in the USA (baseball, American football etc) are not as prevalent in the rest of the world. Just as it took time for American muggles to appreciate football (soccer), it also took time for American wizards to embrace and be competitive at Quidditch.
