Sahara Desert
The Sahara is found in northern Africa, spans several large countries, and is by far the largest desert in the world. It is also a place where, historically, Quidditch referees have turned up after wizards had transformed their brooms into Portkeys. This little bit of trivia is mentioned in Quidditch Through the Ages, and was one of the things Harry found most interesting in the book the first time he read it (PS11).
Sahara Desert means "deserts desert", as the plural Arabic word ṣaḥārā  means "deserts" - most people who know this just refer to it in English as 'the Sahara'.
