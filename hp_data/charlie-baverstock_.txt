Charlie Baverstock is the Manager of New Zealand’s Quidditch Team in 2014.
At the 2014 Quidditch World Cup, Baverstock expressed his anger in colourful language after his star Chaser Dennis Moon was sent off by a Referee in their first match of the tournament – a dramatic loss against the eventual tournament winners, Bulgaria (QWC).
Charlie, a nickname for Charles, means "manly and strong, a free man" (Quick Baby Names).
Baverstock is an area within the city of Hamilton, New Zealand. There is also an area of Auckland called Baverstock Oaks. The surname is of Anglo-Saxon origin - from Baverstock in Wiltshire (recorded as Babanstoc or Babestoche), meaning "Babba's farm" (Internet Surname Database).
