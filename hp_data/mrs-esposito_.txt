"That you, Tina?...Are you alone?"
--Mrs. Esposito (WFT)
Mrs. Esposito was the landlady of the building where the Goldstein sisters live. She did not allow tenants to have men on the premises (WFT).
The rule about having no men present lends to the assumption that the Goldstein sisters lived in a building forÂ female boarders only.
