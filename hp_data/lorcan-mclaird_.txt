Lorcan McLaird was an eccentric Minister for Magic who was in office for just two years (1923-1925).
McLairdâ€™s eccentricities included speaking only in monosyllables and blowing puffs of smoke from his wand. His antics irritated constituents until they forced him from office (MoM)
"Lorcan" is the name of several High Kinds of Ireland. A "laird" is a Scottish Lord or owner of a large estate. The two names together denote someone of possibly royal birth or great inherited wealth.
