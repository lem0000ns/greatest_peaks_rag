First Introduced CS6: Gilderoy Lockhart

"... but since I made her read Lockhart’s books I think she’s begun to see how useful it’ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family…”
-- Justin Finch-Fletchley (CS6)
Mrs. Finch-Fletchley was the Muggle mother of Justin Finch-Fletchley.
After Justin’s Hogwarts letter arrived, Mrs. Finch-Fletchley was initially a bit unhappy that her son would not being attending Eton as planned. However, she may have become more enthusiastic after Justin had her read the books of Gilderoy Lockhart (CS6).
Mrs. Finch-Fletchley and her husband are both Muggles. Their son, Justin, is a wizard.
