Question: Whose murders did Voldemort use to create each of the Horcruxes?
J.K. Rowling: The diary - Moaning Myrtle. The cup - Hepzibah Smith, the previous owner. The locket - a Muggle tramp. Nagini - Bertha Jorkins (Voldemort could use a wand once he regained a rudimentary body, as long as the victim was subdued). The diadem - an Albanian peasant. The ring - Tom Riddle senior.

When he found Ravenclaw’s diadem in Albania, Voldemort killed a peasant and used his or her death to turn the priceless object into a Horcrux (BLC).
There's an inconsistency about the creation of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Dumbledore told Harry that he only used "significant deaths" (HBP23), and that is true for the ring that belonged to Marvolo Gaunt - he used the murder of his own father, Tom Riddle. Yet for something as important as the diadem of Ravenclaw, Voldemort used an insignificant Albanian peasant who meant nothing to him. He also used a "Muggle tramp" to create the Horcrux from Slytherin's locket, which seems even more unbelievable considering the way Tom Riddle revered his ancestor Salazar Slytherin. Why would Dumbledore say that the deaths had to be significant, when actually most of them were not?
