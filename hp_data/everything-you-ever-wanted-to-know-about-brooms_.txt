Everything you ever wanted to know about: Brooms

I’ve been taking a break from my big project, working on fixing broken links and minor errors and so forth. Then last night, Belinda and I started chatting about some of the Lexicon’s “forgotten” pages, that don’t really have a section and so are in a bit of disrepair, and thinking we might take a whirl at fixing them up when we get time.
So, after three hours of gutting and recreating a page, I’ve got my first one done: Brooms. As always, I’d love to hear about it if there’s information you feel is missing or incorrect!
