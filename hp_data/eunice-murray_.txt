First Introduced QA7: Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland

"....[a] faster Snitch because this is just too easy...."
-- Eunice Murray (QA7)
Eunice Murray played Seeker for the Montrose Magpies Quidditch team. She died in 1942.
Murray petitioned for a speedier Golden Snitch for the game of Quidditch, as she felt the current model was too slow (QA7).
A talented Seeker with keen eyesight and swift reflexes
Eunice is the Latin form of the Greek name Ευνικη (Eunike) which meant "good victory" - from ευ (eu) "good" and νικη (nike) "victory" (Behind the Name).
Murray is a surname of Scottish and Irish origin and has several Gaelic derivations, including two that mean "a settlement by the sea" or "son of the sea man" (Internet Surname Database).
She would likely have been petitioning the International Confederation of Wizards Quidditch Committee and the International Association of Quidditch if she really wanted to have any substantial changes made to something as important as the magical specifications for the Golden Snitch - unless she was only making the statement to garner publicity or personal acclaim.
