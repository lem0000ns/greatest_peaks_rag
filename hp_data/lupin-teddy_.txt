First Introduced DH25: Shell Cottage

Teddy Lupin is the son of Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks. He is a Metamorphmagus like his mother (DH25, BLC). He was named for his grandfather Ted Tonks, and is the godson of Harry Potter (DH25). Orphaned in the Battle of Hogwarts (DH33) and raised by his grandmother, Andromeda Tonks, he often stops by Harry and Ginny Potter’s for dinner. Like his mother, he was sorted into Hufflepuff at Hogwarts (JKR:Tw).
In his final year at Hogwarts, he was made Head Boy (JKR:Tw). He later became romantically involved with Bill and Fleur Weasley’s daughter, Victoire (DH/e, Pm). They spend most of their time at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup finding dark corners in which to be together (Pm).
Have just heard that James S Potter has been Sorted (to nobody's surprise) into Gryffindor. Teddy Lupin (Head Boy, Hufflepuff) disappointed.

Rowling on leaving Teddy Lupin an orphan at the end of the series:
"I very consciously wanted to show what is one of the great evils of war, which is that totally innocent people are slaughtered. Another great evil of war is that children lose their families." (NO)
