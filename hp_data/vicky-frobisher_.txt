First Introduced OP13: Detention with Dolores

Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better [than Ron] this evening, but Hooper’s a real whiner, he's always moaning about something or other, and Vicky's involved in all sorts of societies. She admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charms Club she'd put Charms first.
-- Angelina Johnson (OP13)
Victoria (Vicky) Frobisher was a Gryffindor Hogwarts student in the 1990s. Vicky was very involved with a number of school clubs and societies, including the Charms Club. She did try out for the Quidditch team in 1995 as well, but made it clear that Charms was her priority. She didn’t make the team (OP13).
Vicky was at least a second year by Harry's sixth year (OP13), but she was probably not in Harry's own year.
Flying (Quidditch), although it's not her first choice of activities
We don't know which year Vicky is in during Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts, but we can narrow it down a little bit. She's not in her first year or she wouldn't have been able to try out for the Quidditch team and it's highly unlikely that she's in Harry's year since those names are pretty much set.
