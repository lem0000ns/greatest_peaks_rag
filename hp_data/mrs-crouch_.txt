Mrs. Crouch was a short, wispy witch who had the terrible and sad experience of watching her husband renounce their son Barty and condemn him to Azkaban. She was ill and dying at the time and she convinced her husband to allow her to trade places with her son in the wizard prison. Mother and son drank Polyjuice Potion to take each other’s appearance. She died shortly thereafter in Azkaban and was buried by the Dementors outside the walls under her son’s name (GF27, GF30, GF35).
Spouse: Barty Crouch Sr.
Son: Barty Crouch Jr.
