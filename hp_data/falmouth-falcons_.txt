Randolph Keitch and Basil Horton played for the Falcons in the early 1900s and later founded the Comet Trading Company and invented the Keitch-Horton Braking Charm (QA9).
Falcon fans and players were thrown into confusion by the introduction of Re-visibility spectacles at Exmoor for the match against Pride of Portree (DP2).
The team were said to be “in danger of relegation” following a loss to the Chudley Cannons (DP4).
Falmouth, a port town in Cornwall, has football team (Falmouth Town FC), a rugby union team (Falmouth RFC) and a cricket team (Falmouth CC) noted on its Wikipedia entry, but no Quidditch team (Wikipedia).
According to Unfogging the Future, the Falcon as a tea leaf symbol means “a deadly enemy” (PA6).
