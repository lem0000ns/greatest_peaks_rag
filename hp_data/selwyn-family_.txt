First Introduced DH4: The Seven Potters

A pure-blood wizarding family, listed in the ‘Pure-Blood Directory’ (c. 1930) as one of the ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight’ families (Pm).
The name still commands respect in pure-blood circles in the 1990s, as Umbridge uses Slytherin’s locket to pretend she is related to the Selwyns, thereby bolstering her false pure-blood credentials (DH13).
A Notable member of the family is:
Selwyn
