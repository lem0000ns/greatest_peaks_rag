Tilden Toots was wizard with “three green thumbs” who hosted a Wizarding Wireless radio show on Herbology. He was married to the author Daisy Hookum (JKR, WoM).
Quote from his radio show:
. . . be sure to tune in next time when we’ll be discussing the right way to skin a Gurdyroot and what to do if Muggles hear your Honking Daffodils. Until next time, that’s Tootle-oo from Toots!
Married to Daisy Hookum who wrote "My Life as a Muggle" after giving up magic for one year (JKR).
Great at sharing his gardening know-how. Invented Rejuicing and Regerminating Potion.
"Tilden Toots" is possibly a pun on "Tilled-in Roots."
Tilden might have been at Hogwarts along with the Potters, the Longbottoms, Sirius Black, and Snape since he was born in 1959, just a year before most of them.
