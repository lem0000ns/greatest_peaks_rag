First Introduced WFT: Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them (film)

"Right. What are you really doing here?"
-- British Envoy to Newt Scamander (WFT)
The British envoy is an English political figure who, in 1926, was present at MACUSA to discuss how to capture criminal Gellert Grindelwald (WFT).
The name of the British Envoy is "Hector Podmore" according to information on the United Agents page for actor Richard Clothier, who portrayed the British Envoy in the first Fantastic Beasts movie (WFT). This could mean he was possibly related to Sturgis Podmore who was part of the Advance Guard of the Order of the Phoenix (OP3), but this is not technically canon since his name is not given in the Fantastic Beasts script.
