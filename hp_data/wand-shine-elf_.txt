Profession Wand-shiner
First Introduced FB/f: Fantastic Beasts (film series)

In the MACUSA Lobby in 1926, a house-elf was shining wands using a feathery contraption (WFT).
Cleaned and polished wands for witches and wizards at MACUSA. The mechanism used was "complex."
Possibly a reference to a "shoe shiner" or "shoe shine boy," traditionally male, who operated in hotels and along the streets of large cities such as New York in the 1920s and for decades after that. There is a famous song called "Chattanooga Shoe Shine Boy" from 1950 that was covered by many famous artists up until the 1960s.
