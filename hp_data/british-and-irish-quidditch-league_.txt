British and Irish Quidditch League
"....professional Quidditch teams have been limited in number since 1674 when the League was established. At that time, the thirteen best Quidditch teams in Britain and Ireland were selected to join the League"
-- Quidditch Through the Ages (QA7)
The British and Irish Quidditch League is the professional league of Quidditch teams for England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (QA7).
The British and Irish Quidditch League was established in 1674. At that time the Department of Magical Games and Sports decided to limit both the number of Quidditch games and the number of professional teams, in order to be able to comply with the International Statute of Secrecy (QA7).
The thirteen most successful Quidditch teams in Britain and Ireland formed the League and compete each year to win the League Cup (QA7). Their headquarters are on the 7th Level of the Ministry of Magic (OP7).
The other teams were asked to discontinue with large scale matches and competitions. These now non-professional teams are allowed to hold Quidditch games if they comply with all secrecy restrictions (QA7).
