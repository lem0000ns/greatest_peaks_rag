International Confederation of Wizards Quidditch Committee (I.C.W.Q.C.)
The International Confederation of Wizards Quidditch Committee (I.C.W.Q.C.) is an organisation which regulates Quidditch on an international level. The ICWQC was created after the International Statute of Secrecy was implemented in order to find suitable venues for the Quidditch World Cup to take place and to police the games. It also publishes The Official Guide to the Quidditch World Cup (Pm).
The ICWQC officially discourages the traditional Japanese practice of setting fire to their brooms after a defeat (QA8).
