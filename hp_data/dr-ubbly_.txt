Dr. Ubbly


					Dr. Ubbly
			
Gender Male

Presumably the creator of Dr. Ubblyâ€™s Oblivious Unction, a topical treatment for scars (OP38).
The Unction was prescribed to Ron by Madam Pomfrey to heal the welts left by the brain that attacked him in the Department of Mysteries (OP38).
It's unclear what sort of doctor Dr. Ubbly is supposed to be, since healers are the doctors of the Wizarding world (OP23, 30, TBB/FFF). -BB
