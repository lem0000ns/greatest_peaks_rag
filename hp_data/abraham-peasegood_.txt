First Introduced QA8: The Spread of Quidditch Worldwide

Abraham Peasegood was an American wizard who invented the game of Quodpot (QA8). Peasegood immigrated to North America in the 1700s, intending to form a Quidditch team when he got there. The story goes that the Quaffle he had packed in his luggage came into contact with his wand so that when he took it out to play with it, the Quaffle exploded. This was the inspiration for his creating a game where the balls exploded.
He may be an ancestor of Arnie Peasegood, who was an Obliviator around Harry's time at Hogwarts (GF7).
