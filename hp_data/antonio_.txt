Gender Male Species / Race Chupacabra Distinguishing Features Part-lizard, Part-homunculus with large fangs for sucking blood

A baby chupacabra named Antonio was chained under the chair of prisoner Gellert Grindelwald in MACUSA Headquarters. While placed there as a threat to the dark wizard, Antonio helped him escape when Ministry Aurors were moving him out of MACUSA custody in New York City (CG). The creature sank his fangs into the neck of an Auror named Spielman so Grindelwald could take control of a Thestral-drawn carriage. He was rewarded with a pat on the head just before Grindelwald called him “needy” and unceremoniously dumped him into the dark Atlantic Ocean along with the wounded Auror.
