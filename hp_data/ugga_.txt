First Introduced QA3: The Game From Queerditch Marsh

Ugga is mentioned in a letter from Goodwin Kneen to his cousin Olaf in Norway describing an early Kwidditch match.
Ugga missed hitting a “Blooder” (an old word for a Bludger) with his club and it hit Radulf the blacksmith, another member of his team. This match was the first to use baskets (old beer or wine barrels mounted on stilts) for goal-scoring (QA3).
