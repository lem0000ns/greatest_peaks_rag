"A terrible loss. She was a great witch..."
-- Albus Dumbledore (HBP4)
Amelia Susan Bones was the sister of Edgar Bones and the aunt of Susan Bones. Before her murder by Death Eaters, Amelia was the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement (OP6) and presided over the Wizengamot (OP8), including Harry’s disciplinary hearing on August 12, 1995. She later told her niece Susan some of the details.
She is described as being a broad, square-jawed witch with very short gray hair, thick eyebrows and a monocle. According to Tonks, Amelia was fair and honest.
Amelia Bones was murdered “nastily” by Death Eaters in the first weeks of the Second Wizarding War (late June or early July 1996) (HBP1). Muggle newspapers reported the crime and described her as a “middle-aged woman who lived alone.” Fudge believes that the murder was carried out by Voldemort himself (HBP1).
