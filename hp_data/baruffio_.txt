First Introduced PS10: Hallowe’en

'Never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.'
- Professor Flitwick (PS10)
Baruffio was a wizard who mispronounced a charm and suffered for it (PS10). Lent his name to some patent medicine of dubious value called Baruffio’s Brain Elixir (OP31).
Professor Flitwick warned the first year class about what happened to Baruffio when they were learning the Levitation spell.
