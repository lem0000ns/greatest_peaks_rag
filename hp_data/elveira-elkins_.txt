"No matter how hard I try, I find I am unable to make a simple Fixing Charm 'stick'."
-- Elveira Elkins (DP3)
Elveira Elkins was a witch whose letter appeared on the Problem Page of the Daily Prophet (DP3).
Ms Elkins’ letter explained that everything she tried to charm had failed. She was advised by author Zamira Gulch to pay more attention when performing spells and in the meantime to try using Muggle “nails” to put her pictures and mirrors up (DP3).
Although the date printed on the third Daily Prophet Newsletter (DP3) is 1 June 1999, the timeframe for this event is 1992-1993.
