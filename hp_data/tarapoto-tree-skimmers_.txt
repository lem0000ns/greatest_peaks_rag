Tarapoto Tree-Skimmers
The Tarapoto Tree-Skimmers are a South American Quidditch team who come from Peru (QA8).
Unlike most of South America, who play the North American game of Quodpot, Peruvian wizards learned to play Quidditch from the European wizards who came to oversee the breeding and numbers of Peruvian Vipertooth dragons. The country is now Quidditch-mad. The Tree-Skimmers are their most popular team and recently toured Europe with success (QA8).
Their Captain is João Coelho, who attended the Castelobruxo wizarding school in Brazil (Pm).
The city of Tarapoto in northern Peru has a football team listed in its Wikipedia entry, but no Quidditch team (Wikipedia).
