First Introduced OP3: The Advance Guard

Hestia Jones was a new member of the Order of the Phoenix. She was a pink-cheeked, black-haired witch who was part of the Advance Guard that helped Harry in his escape from Privet Drive (OP3), and assigned to escort the Dursleys to safety before Harry’s departure (DH3).
 
 
"Hestia" means goddess of the hearth, from Greek hestia "hearth, house, home, family." "Jones is a common surname, literally meaning "John's (child)."
There is a possibility that Hestia Jones is related to Gwenog Jones, Megan Jones, and Peter Jones, though the surname "Jones" is quite common. There is no canon-identified relationship between any of these Joneses.
Hestia's name is similar to that of Hester Jonas, a German midwife and herbalist executed for witchcraft in 1635. Peter Maiwald dedicated a poem to her in the 1970s that was adapted and set to music by the German folkband Cochise. --KT
