Profession Manager of the Puddlemere United Quidditch team

"We feel it is time for a change of image."
-- Philbert Deverill (DP1)
Philbert Deverill was the manager of Puddlemere United Quidditch team during the early 1990s. He was interviewed in the Daily Prophet.
He states that they are changing the design of the team’s robes from a brown colour and denied they are considering chameleon cloaks (DP1).
Deverill praises newly signed Chaser Wilda Griffiths after the team, wearing the new kingfisher blue robes, win their match against the Wigtown Wanderers (DP2).
Leadership, open to change
Philbert comes from the name Filibert (via Philibert) which derives from Greek φιλος (philos) "friend, lover" (Behind the Name).
Deverill is a locational surname from the parish of the same name in Wiltshire. It comes from the Old Welsh dwfrial (meaning "the river of the ial" or "fertile upland region") or British Celtic Dubroialon (meaning "the ial on the stream") (Internet Surname Database).
The change of robe colour from mud brown to kingfisher blue conflicts with the information in Quidditch Through the Ages (QA7), where Puddlemere are assigned a sky-blue colour for their team robes.
Although Deverill is not specifically named, Puddlemere's upcoming match against the Holyhead Harpies has a warning about wands (DP3) and the Prophet reports on the chaos and violence that took during the actual game (DP4).
Although the dates printed on the Daily Prophet Newsletters are:
the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
