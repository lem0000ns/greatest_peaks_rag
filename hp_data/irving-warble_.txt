Irving Warble is a composer and the third husband of Celestina Warbeck (Pm).
His wife, a famous popular singer, has been married to Mr Warble since leaving her second husband (after a ten year marriage and one child) (Pm).
To warble is to sing like a bird, with trills and embellishments.
A very famous American composer is called Irving, Irving Berlin (1888-1989). The composer George Gershwin called Berlin "the greatest songwriter that has ever lived", so perhaps Irving Warble was attracted to (and attractive to) Celestina by writing some of her hit wizarding songs.
