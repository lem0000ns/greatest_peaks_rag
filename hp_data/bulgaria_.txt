Bulgaria
Bulgaria is a country in eastern Europe.
The Bulgarian National Team played in several Quidditch World Cup matches, finally winning the tournament in 2014 (GF8, QWC).
During the 1994 tournament, we also learned then that Bulgaria has a Ministry of Magic, including their Minister for Magic, Mr. Oblansk (GF8).
It is the home of the famous Quidditch player and Seeker, Viktor Krum (GF5, GF8, QWC).
Making their home in the city of Vratsa, Bulgaria’s best Quidditch team is the Vratsa Vultures (QA7).
Although Bulgaria has a World Cup-winning national Quidditch team there is not any mention of Wizard sports - or any other Wizard activity - listed on Bulgaria's Wikipedia page (Wikipedia).
