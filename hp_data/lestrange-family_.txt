The Lestrange Family Tree:

'Lestrange' could refer to Roger L'Estrange, an aristocratic 17th-century English journalist who was very much against religious tolerance (Cambridge History of English and American Literature).
From the Surname Database: "Recorded in various spellings as shown below, this is a confusing surname of great antiquity. It can probably be best described as of French origins from the time after the Norman Conquest of 1066, when for three centuries French was the language of England, and in effect this surname like the surname Newman, was a nickname for a comer-in to an area. The early recordings of the name are found in the county of Norfolk, and later in Yorkshire. It should not be assumed that these necessarily described Frenchmen, although this is likely."
