The name Abbott may be intended to connect this person to the Abbott family in England, a family which included Hannah Abbott in Harry's year at Hogwarts.
There was an American scholar with a similar name: Theophilus C. Abbot (one less "t" on the last name). He lived from 1826-1892 and taught English in Vermont and Ann Arbor, Michigan.
