Mr. and Mrs. Bones


					Mr. and Mrs. Bones
			
First Introduced PS4: The Keeper of the Keys

Mr. and Mrs. Bones were a couple killed by Death Eaters in the 1970s (PS4, BN). Either Susan’s grandparents or her aunt and uncle Edgar. When asked in a 2000 interview if the Boneses who were killed were related to Susan, JKR said “They were her grandparents.” Rowling may have later changed the relationship when she wrote book five.
