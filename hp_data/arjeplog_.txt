Arjeplog
A small city in the foothills of the mountains in northern Sweden, Arjeplog has for over a millenium been the location of the finishing line for the annual broom race of Sweden (QA2). It is also less than three hundred miles away from a Swedish Short Snout dragon reservation, which is most likely in the higher parts of the mountains.
