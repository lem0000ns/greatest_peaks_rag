First Introduced OP31: O.W.L.s

Eddie Carmichael was a Hogwarts student who earned nine “Outstanding” O.W.L.s the year before Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat their O.W.L.s. He assured Harry and Ron that the credit belonged solely to Baruffio’s Brain Elixir (OP31).
Hermione confiscated the Brain Elixir it before the boys could buy any -- quite possibly saving them a trip to the hospital wing in the process, considering the general quality of brain stimulants circulating that year (OP31).
