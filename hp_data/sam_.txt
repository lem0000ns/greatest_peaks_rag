"Hey, Sam - does Cecily know you been seeing Ruby?"
--Queenie Goldstein (WFT)
Sam was a MACUSA Obliviator at the time of Newt Scamander’s visit to New York.
Sam dated a fellow MACUSA worker named Ruby and was apparently involved with another witch, named Cecily, at the same time. Queenie’s knowledge of this secret (through Legilimency) allowed her to use blackmail to rescue Jacob Kowalski, whom Sam was charged with Obliviating (WFT).
