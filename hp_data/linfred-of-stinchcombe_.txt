First Introduced Pm: Pottermore

Twelfth-century ancestor and progenitor of the Potter family (Pm). Inventor of Skele-gro and PepperUp Potion (although this is also credited to Glover Hipworth (FW) in the 18th century).
An eccentric man known for pottering in his garden, making potions which his Muggle neighbours believed to be simple herbal remedies, Linfred earned himself the nickname 'the Potterer', which ultimately became the surname 'Potter' (Pm).
Children: Linfred had seven children, of whom Hardwin was the eldest. Hardwin married Iolanthe Peverell, bringing the Cloak of Invisibility into the Potter family.
