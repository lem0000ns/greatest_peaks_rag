Alas, I have Transfigured my Feet
Alas, I have Transfigured my Feet (Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré mes Pieds) is a play written in the early 1400s featuring characters named “Grenouille” and “Crapaud” (“Frog” and “Toad,” a nod to the characters in the books by Arnold Lobel). The script includes a reference to playing Quidditch (QA8, BoS2).
Malecrit is from the French - mal ecrit - meaning 'badly written'. We can probably assume this is not a very good play, and the three lines given in Quidditch Through The Ages certainly support that theory!
