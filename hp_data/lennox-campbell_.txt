-- match report in the Daily Prophet (DP2)
Lennox Campbell is a Quidditch player who played Seeker for the Montrose Magpies Quidditch team in the 1990s (DP2).
During a match against the Kenmare Kestrels, Campbell understandably missed the Snitch kicked at him by Magpies Chaser Alasdair Maddock, allowing the opposing Seeker to catch it and causing the Magpies to lose the game (DP2).
Lennox usually appears as a Scottish surname, related to the district Lennox, which was originally recorded as Leuenaichs and Levanaux in the twelfth century. It derives from Old Gaelic leamhan + ach ("of the elm field") (Internet Surname Database).
Campbell is a Gaelic surname deriving from cam béul meaning "wry or crooked mouth". It may also derive from Latin de bello campo meaning "of the fair field" (Behind the Name).
