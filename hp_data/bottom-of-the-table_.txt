Bottom-of-the-Table
"....and nobody would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries."
-- Harry Potter's thoughts prior to the Gryffindor v Ravenclaw match (HBP24)
The Bottom-of-the-Table is the position of last place in the standings. This term can be used at the end of a sports tournament or competition, or at the end of the season on the League Table.
In the 1990s, the bottom of the British and Irish Quidditch League was usually held by the Chudley Cannons Quidditch team, who were on a record 17-year losing streak (DP). They were so often at the bottom that, when persuading him to do a last favour, Albus Dumbledore tells Severus Snape with complete certainty:
“….as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year’s league.” (DH33)

The term "bottom-of-the-league" can also be used to describe the team sitting in last place position at any time.
