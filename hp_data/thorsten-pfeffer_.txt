"Pfeffer today attempted the life-threatening Feint with awful consequences, failing to pull out in time and colliding with the ground at what onlookers estimated to be sixty miles an hour."
-- match report Wales v Germany, Daily Prophet, 22 May 2014 (Pm)
Thorsten Pfeffer played Seeker for the German National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
During their first match against the Welsh side in the Quidditch World Cup 2014 tournament, Pfeffer was fooled into a steep dive by the Welsh Seeker's Wronski Defensive Feint. Although Pfeffer broke most of his bones - and thought he was now a bird - his manager Faust thought he would make a complete recovery following further treatment. Germany lost the match by 330 points to 100 (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Pfeffer must have been born after 1976.
Thorsten, an alternate form of Torsten, derives from the Old Norse name Þórsteinn, which meant "Thor's stone" (Þórr) combined with steinn "stone" (Behind the Name).
Pfeffer is a German surname meaning "pepper" (Wikipedia).
