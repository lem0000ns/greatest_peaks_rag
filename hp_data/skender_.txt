Skender runs The Circus Arcanus, a travelling wizarding circus and freak show, and acts as ringmaster and animal trainer.
He was in New York with The Circus Arcanus for two weeks in 1926, starting on 29 November, and ending with a “spectacular” final show on 13 December.
In 1927, the circus performed in Paris on Rue Claudel and Rue Girardon, and was attended by many in the wizarding communities. Skender promptly fled Paris when his circus was engulfed in fire started by Credence and Nagini (CG).
"Skender points his wand at the tent, shrinks it to the size of a handkerchief  and pockets it" (CG).
As costume designer Colleen Atwood described him "He's not a very good ringmaster and he's got a dark edge to him."
Skender's wand is varnished brown with a gold band and a red bulb on the handle.
