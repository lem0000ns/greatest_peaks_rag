Kimiko Kurosawa was a Chaser on the Japanese National Team at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014.
Along with fellow Chasers Ryuichi Yamaguchi and Yoshi Wakahisa, Kurosawa was part of the Japanese side at the 2014 tournament (Pm).
Japan won their first match against Poland and a quarter-final match against the Nigerian team. However, they then lost to Bulgaria at the semi-final stage (Pm).
To secure a third place in the tournament, the Japanese team gained a hard fought win against a talented American Quidditch side from the United States (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Kurosawa must have been born after 1976.
As she comes from Japan, Kurosawa will have attended the Mahoutokoro Wizarding School, as all the members of the Japanese national side are said to have done so (Pm).
Kimiko is a Japanese girl's name deriving from 貴 (ki) meaning "valuable" with 美 (mi) meaning "beautiful", or 君 (kimi) meaning "lord, noble", combined with 子 (ko) meaning "child" (Behind the Name).
Kurosawa comes from the Japanese 黒 (kuro) meaning "black" and 澤 (sawa) meaning "marsh". Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998) was an Academy Award winning Japanese film director (Behind the Name).
