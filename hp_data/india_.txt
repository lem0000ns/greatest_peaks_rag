India
India is the second most populous country in the world (behind China), located in southern Asia and jutting into the Indian Ocean. The Occamy and the Phoenix are both native to India (FB). The primary mode of wizarding transportation there is the flying carpet, as opposed to broomsticks; as a result, Quidditch has never gained the popularity there that it has in Europe (QA8).
