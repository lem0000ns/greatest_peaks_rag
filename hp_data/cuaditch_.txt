Cuaditch
Cuaditch is an old term for the game of Quidditch.
Writing in a letter to her sister Prudence in 1269, Modesty Rabnott describes her rescue of a Golden Snidget during a game of Cuaditch. She refers to it specifically as the “noble game of Cuaditch” and objects to the cruelty of combining snidget-hunting with the broom sport (QA4).
