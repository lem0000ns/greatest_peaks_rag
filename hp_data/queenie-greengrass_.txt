First Introduced The Class List

Queenie Greengrass was a student in Harry’s year at Hogwarts according to Rowling’s list of “original forty” students (ClassList). The name doesn’t appear anywhere in canon, although a student named Daphne Greengrass does appear, which suggests that Rowling may have changed the name.
