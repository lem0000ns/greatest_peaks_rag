Elfrida Cragg


					Elfrida Cragg
			
Gender Female Species / Race Witch
First Introduced OP22: St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries

Elfrida Cragg is a witch whose portrait hangs in St. Mungo’s. Everard ran into her portrait to watch what happened to Arthur Weasley after he had been injured in order to report back to Dumbledore (OP22).
This is probably a misprint for Elfrida Clagg, the famous Chiefteness of the Wizard’s Council in the 1600s.
Frida was the name of one of Rowling's grandmothers.
