First Introduced QA9: The Development of the Racing Broom

Leonard Jewkes was the designer of the popular Silver Arrow broom (QA9).
Unfortunately, he was unable to manufacture enough brooms to keep up with the demand (QA9).
Leonard means "brave lion" and is derived from Latin leo (meaning "lion") and the Germanic word hard "brave, hardy" (Behind the Name).
Jewkes is a surname of Breton-Cornish origin and is derived from the first name "Iudicael", meaning "lord" and "generous, bountiful" (Internet Surname Database).
The broom was speedy, but he was not.
