Bogomil Levski
 
Levski means "like a lion" in archaic Bulgarian (modern Bulgarian lăv) and the name Lev means "like a lion" in Russian and several other Eastern European languages (Baby Namespedia).
The currency of Bulgaria is a "lev" and there are lions featured on the notes and coins (Wikipedia).
The name could also have been inspired by the Bulgarian hero Vasil Levski (aka Vasil Ivanov Kunchev, 1837-1873) (Wikipedia).
