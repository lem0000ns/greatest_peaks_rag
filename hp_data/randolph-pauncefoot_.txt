"....you do have to be a bit deranged to play golf"
-- Randolph Pauncefoot interviewed in the Daily Prophet (DP3)
Randolph Pauncefoot was a fan of the Montrose Magpies Quidditch team (DP3).
Mr Pauncefoot (42) was interviewed by the Daily Prophet after its manager fired Alasdair Maddock. He was not supportive of the manager's treatment of the Magpies' Chaser and felt that what Maddock did in his spare time was his own business (DP3).
Randolph, a variation of the earlier Randolf, is a name of Germanic origin (rand "rim of a shield" and wulf "wolf") (Behind the Name).
The English surname Pauncefoot has two sources. One is a place originally called Pantesfort (now called Ponsford), found in the 1086 Domesday Book for Devonshire.  The other was first recorded in the Domesday Book for Hampshire as Paunceuolt, as the name of a man with a large belly (pance meaning "paunch" and volt meaning "rounded") (Internet Surname Database).
Although the date printed on the Daily Prophet Newsletter DP3 is 1 June 1999, the timeframe for that event is 1992-1993.
