Profession "Agony Aunt" advice columnist
First Introduced DP3: Daily Prophet Issue 3

"You will find that it will be difficult to fall back in love with the wizard once you have had his worst faults and habits revealed to you under the [Hate] Potion’s influence."
-- Grizel Hurtz (DP3)
Grizel Hurtz is the “Agony Aunt” of the Daily Prophet and one of the experts featured on the Problem Page (DP3).
Ms Hurtz advised lovelorn witch Lilith Molesby about the drawbacks of using a Love Potion to force a wizard to be in love with her. She recommended a course of Hate Potions as a corrective measure (DP3).
Agony Aunts are know for plain-speaking , often with a touch of humour, when giving their advice - as the truth, after all, "Hurtz"....
While the date printed on DP3 is 1 June 1999, the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
