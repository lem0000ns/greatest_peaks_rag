"No foul! German referee Herman Junker concludes that Rafael Santos did not mean to hit Viktor Krum around the back of the skull with his Beater's bat."
-- Ginny Weasley reporting for the Daily Prophet during the 2014 Quidditch World Cup final (Pm)
Rafael Santos was a Beater for Brazil’s National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
Together with Beater Carlos Clodoaldo, Santos was a part of the Brazilian team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup and, although their early performances in the tournament were "lackluster", the team won against Haiti and Wales (Pm).
As recommended in "The Beaters' Bible", Santos's strategy in the next two matches was to target the opposing Seeker, and he and Clodoaldo prevented a victory to the United States in the semi-finals with "precision-hit" Bludgers aimed at American Seeker Darius Smackhammer (Pm).
Santos also hit Bulgarian Seeker Viktor Krum hard over the head with his Beater's bat in the final (although the referee ruled that this was unintentional). However, the Brazilians ultimately lost to Bulgaria by a margin of 170 points to 60 (Pm).
Precision aim
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Santos must have been born after 1976.
Rafael, the Portuguese version of the Hebrew name Raphael, means "one who is healed by God" (Quick Baby Names).
Santos is an extremely old Christian surname derived from the Latin word sanctus, meaning "blameworthy, saintly" (Surname database).
As he comes from Brazil, it is possible that Santos attended the Castelobruxo Wizarding School.
