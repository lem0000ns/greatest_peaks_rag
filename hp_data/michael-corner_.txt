First Introduced OP16: In the Hog’s Head

Ravenclaw, 1991 – 1998
Michael is a dark-haired boy who met Ginny Weasley at the Yule Ball and began dating her at the end of the 1994 – 1995 school year; through Ginny, Michael and his friends joined the DA (OP16). Michael sulked so much after Gryffindor defeated Ravenclaw in 1996 that Ginny dumped him, after which he took up with Cho Chang (OP38). He actively fought against the Carrows’ regime at Hogwarts, and took part in the final battle (DH29).
Although never explicitly mentioned, Michael was probably part of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team. Ginny calls him a "sore loser" which is an odd term if he was merely a spectator.
Michael Corner appeared on JKR's list of students in Harry's year (HPM) but was noted as a Hufflepuff on that paper. This list contradicts books in many places and cannot be considered canon.
