"Dimitrov skins Moran - deliberately flying to collide there - and it’s got to be another penalty...."
-- Ludo Bagman's match commentary of Bulgaria v Ireland, 25 August 1994 (GF8)
Dimitrov was a Chaser for the Bulgarian National Team at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup tournament.
Along with fellow Chasers, Levski and Ivanova, Dimitrov was a member of the Bulgarian team that lost to the Irish side in the final match of the Quidditch World Cup in 1994. The other members of the 1994 team were Viktor Krum (Seeker), Volkov and Vulchanov (Beaters) and the Keeper Zograf (GF8).
The tournament was overshadowed by the appearance in the campground of Lord Voldemort’s Dark Mark after the match (GF9, Pm).
Dimitrov (Bulgarian Димитров) means "son of Dimitar". Dimitar comes from Latin Demetrius  and Greek Δημητριος (Demetrios), which are both from the Greek goddess Demeter: δα (da) "earth" and μητηρ (meter) "mother" (Behind the Name).
