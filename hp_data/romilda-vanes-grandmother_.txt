"Well, take these ... Chocolate Cauldrons, they've got firewhiskey in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don't like them."
-- Romilda Vane (HBP15)
Romilda Vane’s grandmother was supposedly the source of the Chocolate Cauldrons which Romilda gave to Harry Potter. In fact, the Cauldrons were filled with a love potion and she was trying to get Harry to take her to Slughorn’s Christmas party (HBP15).
