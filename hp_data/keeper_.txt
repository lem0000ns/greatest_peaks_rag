Keeper
"I'm Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring."
-- Oliver Wood explaining Quidditch to Harry Potter (PS10)
The Keeper is the Quidditch player who guards the goal hoops and tries to prevent the opposing team’s Chasers from scoring by passing the Quaffle through one of the hoops. There is one Keeper per team.
Historically, Keepers had quite a bit of freedom in their actions. Before the scoring areas were introduced around 1620, Keepers were able to move around the pitch – and even score on the other team (QA6).

Prior to the late 19th century, Chasers routinely ganged up on Keepers, three to one, in order to make it easier to score. In 1884 the “Stooging Penalty” was added to the game of Quidditch. This prohibited more than one Chaser entering the scoring area and “flattening” the Keeper (QA6).
A French play from the 1400s “Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré Les Pieds” (English translation: Alas, I’ve Transfigured My Feet) featured a character who chose to play Keeper over taking a cow to market (QA8).
Amongst the 700 fouls committed at the first Quidditch World Cup in 1473 was the attempted decapitation of the Keeper (QA8).

Keeper moves and tactics during a match include the Double Eight Loop and Starfish with Stick (QA10).
During Harry Potter’s fifth year at Hogwarts, Ron Weasley joined the Gryffindor Quidditch Team as their Keeper. The Slytherins tried to distract him from saving goals (and undermine Ron’s confidence) by singing a satirical song entitled “Weasley is our King” (OP19).
