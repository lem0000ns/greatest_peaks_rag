Tutshill Tornados 
"Pausing every few pages, he read: an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were winning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal broom-tampering and torture...."
-- Harry Potter with Luna Lovegood's copy of The Quibbler (OP10)

They have a “nine-hundred year history,” according to the Daily Prophet, although the team was actually founded in 1520 (DP2).
The Tornados were having one of their most successful seasons in 1992-93, before losing a crucial game against the Ballycastle Bats (DP2).
They led the League in the fall of 1995 – something that The Quibbler felt was being achieved by illegal means (OP10).
Brevis Birch, Captain (c.1990s) (DP2).
Mervyn Fenwick, Keeper (c.1990s) (DP2).
Roderick Plumpton, Seeker (c.1920s) – he holds the record for the fastest capture of a Snitch from a 1921 game against the Caerphilly Catapults (QA7).
Cho Chang has been a Tornados fan since she was six years old (OP12).
Grogan Stump, Minister for Magic from 1811-1819 who established Department of Magical Games and Sports, was a passionate Tutshill Tornados fan (Pm).
