First Introduced OP10: Luna Lovegood

In the summer of 1995, The Quibbler prints an interview with Doris Purkiss, who claims that Sirius Black is really Stubby Boardman, and that Stubby had been enjoying a romantic dinner with her the day of the murder of the Potters and therefore had an alibi (OP10).
Ms. Purkiss resides at number eighteen, Acanthia Way (OP10).
In the same interview, she told the Quibbler that the final concert for Boardman and his band, the Hobgoblins, was at a church hall in the town of Little Norton circa 1980. It was at this concert that Stubby was “struck in the ear by a turnip” and decided to retire from public life (OP10).
