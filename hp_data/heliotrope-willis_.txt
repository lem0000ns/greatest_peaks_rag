Profession Wizard-Troll Spokesperson
First Introduced DP2: Daily Prophet Issue 2

"What we so often forget is the service they do us in guarding our valuables and ourselves."
-- Heliotrope Willis (DP2)
Heliotrope Willis was the spokesperson for the Troll Rights Movement (DP2).
She brought mountain trolls armed with clubs to a rally held by outspoken supporter of the suppression of trolls, Artemius Lawson. When her trolls stormed the podium, he ran for cover and she gave an impassioned speech supporting troll rights. Unfortunately, her speech was cut short when, according to the Daily Prophet, "one of her club-bearing colleagues concussed her with a careless backhand" (DP2).
A substantial amount of blindness towards the reality of the cause she champions.
Heliotrope is a pink-purple tint that is a representation of the colour of the heliotrope flower, which itself is an old name for several kinds of flower that turn towards the sun (such as sunflowers and marigolds) and now used to refer to plants that are members of the borage family (OED).
Heliotrope is also the surname of one of the characters in The Little White Horse, J.K. Rowling's favourite book as a child (AmazonUK).
While the date printed on DP2 is 8 February 1999, the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
