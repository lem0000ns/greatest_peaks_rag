Witch who banished the Bandon Banshee


					Witch who banished the Bandon Banshee
			
Gender Female Species / Race Witch
First Introduced CS16: The Chamber of Secrets

Gilderoy Lockhart claimed credit for defeating the Bandon Banshee (CS6), but she actually was defeated by a witch with a hairy chin (CS16).
In the original text, the term is "witch with a harelip." In 2004, Bloomsbury officially amended the original text to say "witch with a hairy chin," presumably because the original was deemed offensive to some people.
