Inverness
A city located on the eastern coast of Scotland, where the river Ness flows from Loch Ness into the North Sea, Inverness was the city over which the Banchory Bangers Quidditch team was apprehended by Ministry of Magic officials as they tried to fly off and capture a Hebridean Black dragon for their team mascot (QA5). Inverness is not far from the location where Hogwarts is generally assumed to be.
