"Wladyslaw Wolfke is one to watch: a daring and graceful flier...."
-- Ginny Weasley reporting for the Daily Prophet (Pm)
Wladyslaw Wolfke played Seeker for the Polish National Team at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014.
By the time of Poland’s first match at the 2014 tournament against Japan, Wolfke had replaced Bonawentura Wójcik as the team’s Seeker. The team lost by 350 points to 140, despite their “spirited and dynamic” play (Pm).
Daring and graceful flying
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Wolfke must have been born after 1976.
Wladyslaw is a Slavonic name meaning "rule with glory". It is a variant of the Russian name Vladislav (Baby Namespedia).
Wolfke may derive from the Germanic word wulf, meaning "wolf". Mieczysław Wolfke is a famous Polish physicist (Wikipedia).
Prior to the start of the tournament, Italian Seeker Luciano Volpi was accused of having transfigured himself into Poland's Wójcik, but this was disproved by them appearing together at a press conference. As Wolfke then replaced Wójcik as Seeker, one does wonder whether he and Luciano Volpi ever appeared anywhere together at the same time.... (Pm)
