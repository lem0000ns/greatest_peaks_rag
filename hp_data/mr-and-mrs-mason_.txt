First Introduced CS2: Dobby’s Warning

Mr and Mrs Mason were a builder and his wife, who were dinner guests of the Dursleys’ on Harry’s twelfth birthday – an unfortunate night for all parties involved, especially given Mrs. Mason’s severe ornithophobia (CS1,CS2).
Their surname refers to someone who works in brick and stone, fitting for a builder.
