Musidora Barkwith was the sixteenth-century composer of the unfinished “Wizarding Suite,” the modern version of which features an exploding tuba. That musical piece has been banned since its last performance in 1902 when it blew the roof out of Ackerley Town Hall (FW).
"Musidora" is a Greek name meaning "gift of the Muses," the goddeses of arts such as music and poetry.
Musidora was also the stage name of French silent movie actress Jeanne Roques who starred in a serial called Les Vampires from 1915-1916.
