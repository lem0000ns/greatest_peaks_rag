Comet 140
"The Comet Trading Company's first broom was the Comet 140, this being the number of models that Keitch and Horton had tested prior to its release."
-- Quidditch Through the Ages (QA9)
The Comet 140 was the first of the Comet series of racing brooms produced by the Comet Trading Company, founded by Randolph Keitch and Basil Horton in 1929 (QA9).
The broom’s model number reflected the number of prototypes tested during its development. It incorporated the patented Horton-Keitch Braking Charm (QA9).
The release of this broom started off the fierce competition between the Comet and Cleansweep companies for the lucrative Quidditch market (QA9).
Before their invention of the Horton-Keitch Braking Charm, Quidditch matches must have been quite fun to watch if the players weren't able to stop themselves in time!
