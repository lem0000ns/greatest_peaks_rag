Healing or medical magic is a common form of magic. Healing magic is used by everyone from parents healing a child’s minor injuries using simple remedies found in the book The Healer’s Helpmate to trained Healers and Mediwizards handling complicated and fantastic magical injuries and mishaps at St. Mungo’s Hospital.

A variety of magical maladies are in evidence in the waiting room of St. Mungo’s (OP22):
Hogwarts School has a Hospital Wing staffed by a school Matron (Nurse). During Harry’s years at Hogwarts the school Matron was Madam Pomfrey. Maladies at Hogwarts often involve magic gone a bit awry, since the students are not completely trained to use their magic. As Hagrid puts it,
“I mean, it’s always bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn’ it? Yer expect accidents, don’ yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether…” (HBP19)
Madam Pomfrey has handled things like curing Hermione of the cat features she grew after a Polyjuice Potion accident (CS13), Ron’s dragon bite, petrified students and ghosts, and a simple broken wrist from a broom flying accident (PS9), along with what must be a huge variety of Quidditch injuries.
