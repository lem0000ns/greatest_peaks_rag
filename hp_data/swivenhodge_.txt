Swivenhodge
Swivenhodge is played with an inflated bladder, with players sitting backwards on brooms and using the brush end to knock the bladder back and forth across a hedge. A point is awarded every time an opponent misses (QA2).
The game originated in Herefordshire and, while never extremely popular, is still played by witches and wizards in England (QA2).
The bladder of a pig is usually used in Swivenhodge. The German broom game of Stichstock also uses an inflated bladder, but from a dragon (QA2).
