Profession Ministry employee (Improper Use of Magic Office)
First Introduced BoS: Book of Spells

Orabella Nuttley was a Ministry of Magic employee and the inventor of the Mending Charm. She worked for the British Ministry of Magic’s Improper Use of Magic Office, and was put in charge of logistics for travellers and their luggage for a broom race from Aberdeen to the Colosseum in Rome. The race ended in explosions that damaged the Colosseum, but Nuttley saved the day by demonstrating her own invention, the Mending Charm. Ministry officials on the scene quickly learned the spell and were able to repair the ancient structure before Muggles arrived on the scene. For this, Nuttley was awarded the Order of Merlin, First Class (BoS).
