Ministry of Magic


Profession Minister for Magic
First Introduced Pm: Pottermore

Minister for Magic 1948-1959.  A “cheery” witch, whose tenure as Minister saw peace and prosperity.  She died in office from an allergic reaction to Alihotsy-flavoured fudge. (Pm)
Tuft is either half-blood or pureblood, since the first ever Muggleborn Minister came soon after her.
Wilhelmina Tuft's tenure overlapped with that of four muggle Prime Ministers: Clement Attlee, Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan.  The prosperity of the wizarding world during Tuft's leadership was in direct contrast to muggle Britain, where rationing was still in effect well into the 1950s.
