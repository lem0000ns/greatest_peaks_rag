First Introduced GF33: The Death Eaters

Crabbe Sr. is a Death Eater and the father of Vincent Crabbe. Like his son, Mr. Crabbe is a large fellow — one of the two largest Death Eaters to attend Voldemort’s ‘rebirthing party’ — and a bit dim (GF33, OP26).
Crabbe=“Krabben” Low Ger. ‘to scratch, claw.’ To be crabby is to be bad-tempered and combative, or to complain irritably (OED).
Mr. Crabbe is most likely the Death Eater whose head got turned into a baby's during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, although the name isn't stated in canon.
