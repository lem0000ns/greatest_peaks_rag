Barnton
Barnton is a small village located east of Liverpool in the North-West of England. It was also the home of a notable amateur Quidditch team in the nineteenth century (QA6).
Barnton is likely to be the village located in Cheshire in England. Its Wikipedia page mentions their football team, but does not reference an amateur Quidditch team (Wikipedia).
There is an affluent suburb of Edinburgh in Scotland called Barnton as well, but the Cheshire village seems more likely as the historical location for a Quidditch team.
An historical place called Upper Barnton, home to a troublesome giant (FW), may be related to this town.
