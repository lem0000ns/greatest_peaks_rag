Elladora Ketteridge was a witch who discovered the properties of gillyweed when she nearly suffocated after eating it and recovered only when she stuck her head into a bucket of water (FW).
Unfortunately, Beaumont Marjoribanks was given credit for the discovery of gillyweed instead of Elladora (FW).
