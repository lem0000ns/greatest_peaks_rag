Incantation Accio Pronunciation The "official" pronunciation from Scholastic is "A-see-oh," which is used in the audio version of the books. In Latin, should be hard "c" - "ack-see-oh" Associated terms Summoned, Summoner 
“I just did a Summoning Charm. You know—Accio. And . . . they zoomed out of Dumbledore’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory.”
-- Hermione Granger on borrowing Horcrux books from Dumbledore's Office (DH6)
The Summoning Charm causes an object to fly to the caster, even over quite some distance; the target object is said to have been Summoned. It would seem that the caster must know at least the general location of the object Summoned.
Note: The pronunciation of this spell has been debated by fans. The "official" pronunciation from Scholastic is "A-see-oh." This is the pronunciation used in the audio version of the books. The word is Latin, however, and in Latin the letter C is always pronounced 'hard,' the same as the letter K. Some languages which are descended from Latin, such as Italian, pronounce 'cc' as 'ch,' but this is almost certainly not correct. UPDATE: In the Book of Spells, Accio is pronounced "ACK-see-oh"
"accio" L. send for, summon
