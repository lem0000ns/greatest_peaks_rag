Puddlemere
The Puddlemere United, Dumbledoreâ€™s favorite Quidditch team, calls this town home (QA7).
Curiously, there is no town named Puddlemere in Muggle Britain, although there is Puddletown
There are thirteen teams in the British and Irish Quidditch League, and all but one hail from real towns, or at least something close. The lucky thirteenth: Puddlemere. Where is it? Well, as you can see, we don't really know. Did Rowling just make it up?
None of the other teams in the British and Irish Quidditch League are in the southeast; no Hastings, or Ramsgate, or Ipswich . . . maybe Puddlemere is the southeastern team.
On the theory that "United" might mean it's a regional coalition (a pair of similarly-named towns), SVA even looked for Big/Great & Little, East & West, North & South, Upper & Lower, and Inner & Outer. Nada. Pateley Moor in North Yorkshire was the next closest match.
