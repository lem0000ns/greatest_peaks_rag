Phineas Fletcher was criminal who dealt in illegal items and creatures. He was responsible for the accidental creation of the Hidebehind (FB).
Fletcher was from the eastern side of the Atlantic, but sailedÂ to Massachusetts with a trafficked Demiguise and plans to use the creature's hair to make Invisibility Cloaks in the New World (FB).
Hidebehinds, which favor humans as prey, were created out of mating between Fletcher's Demiguise and a ghoul aboard the ship. Fletcher was cruel to the creatures he controlled, and Magizoologists speculate that this could be the reason Hidebehinds target humans (FB).
Possibly a distant relation to Mundungus Fletcher..?-EJ
