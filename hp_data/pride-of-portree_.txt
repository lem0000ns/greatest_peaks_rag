Pride of Portree 
"Pride of Portree scraped a win, 270-200."
-- match report in the Daily Prophet (DP2)
Scottish Quidditch team from Portree on the Isle of Skye in the Hebrides (QA7)
robes: deep purple with gold star (QA7)
home: Portree
The team was founded in 1292 and are known as "The Prides" (QA7).
The Prides had two league wins in the 1960s (QA7).
According to the Daily Prophet, chaos ensued when the Department of Magical Sports and Games cast an Invisibility Charm on the Quidditch stadium located on Exmoor, making it impossible for Portree and Falmouth Falcons fans to find it (DP1, DP2).
Team members:
It is likely that Dougal McBride may have been fired as Seeker, as he surely would have been in trouble for using an illegal wand to curse the head of the Arrows' Seeker.
Portree, a town on the Isle of Skye in the Hebrides, hosts the Shinty team (game played with sticks and balls) for the Isle of Skye according to its Wikipedia listing, but there is no Quidditch team mentioned (Wikipedia).
The settlement now known as Portree was not called by that name prior to the 1500s. Before that it was called Kiltaraglen ('the church of St. Talarican) from Gaelic Cill Targhlain (Wikipedia). This presents a bit of a problem for the timeline of the team. Perhaps they were called the Pride of Kiltaraglen when they were founded in the 1200s and by lucky happenstance the town's name changed to something alliterative three hundred years later. Or it may be that the team changed its name when the town did.

Although the dates printed on the Daily Prophet Newsletters are DP1: 31 July 1998, DP2: 8 February 1999, DP3: 1 June 1999 and DP4: 1 October 1999, the timeframe for those events is 1992-1993.
