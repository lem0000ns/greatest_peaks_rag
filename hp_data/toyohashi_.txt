Toyohashi
The most successful Japanese Quidditch team is based in Toyohashi – the Toyohashi Tengu. From an international perspective, this team is rather unusual in that it ceremonially sets fire to its brooms following each defeat (QA8). The city of Toyohashi, located on Japan’s southern Pacific coast, is thousands of years old but known today for a city filled with parks and its desire to have industry and commerce coexist along with nature.
