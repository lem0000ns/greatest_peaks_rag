Twigger 90
The Twigger was developed by Flyte and Barker in 1990 as an alternative to the popular and technically advanced Nimbus series of brooms. The Twigger was an expensive and good-looking product but ultimately its defects meant that it was only bought by wizards who wanted to flash their money about. As it warps under high speeds, the Twigger has never been used for Quidditch (QA9).
