Profession Quidditch player (Seeker)
First Introduced QWC: The Quidditch World Cup (essays)

"....exhausted Liechtenstein Seeker Bruno Bruunhart managed to grab the Snitch inches from the outstretched hand of Jacques Miskine. Both teams wept and embraced as they finally reached solid ground."
-- the third day finish of Chad v Liechtenstein, Daily Prophet, 19 May 2014 (QWC)
Bruno Bruunhart played Seeker for Liechtenstein’s National Team at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014 (QWC).
The team qualified for the 2014 tournament with a shock win over the China (QWC).
Their first match against Chad became a three-day marathon, ending when Bruunhart finally caught the Snitch – to the relief of everyone involved (QWC).
Liechtenstein fell out of the tournament at the quarter-final stage, when they lost to the USA by 450 points to 290. Their failure was further rubbed in by some American fans who kidnapped their team mascot, Hans the Augurey, after the match (QWC).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (QWC), Bruunhart must have been born after 1976.
Bruno means "brown" and is of Germanic origin (Baby Namespedia).
Bruunhart is likely to be a compound surname, from bruun (a Northern Germanic variant also meaning "brown") (Wikipedia) and hart (from the Old English word heorot meaning "deer, stag", which originally comes from old German herutaz) (Wikipedia).
