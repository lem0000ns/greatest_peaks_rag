Alternate Spelling Apparation 
"Maybe he knows how to Apparate ...Just appear out of thin air, you know."
-- unknown Ravenclaw student on how Sirius Black got into Hogwarts (PA9)
Apparition is an advanced spell used by fully trained witches and wizards to disappear from one place and appear almost instantly somewhere else. A person who uses this spell is referred to as an Apparator. Apparition is typically cast non-verbally.
from "appareo" L. to appear
The spelling varies. Sometimes it's given as "apparation" (e.g. OP4) and other times as "apparition" (as in "side-along apparition" in HBP3).
Some editions of the books do not include Ron's comments about Apparition in CS5. In those edtions, then, Apparition is first mentioned by an unnamed Ravenclaw as a possible way that Sirius Black may have entered Hogwarts (PA6).
