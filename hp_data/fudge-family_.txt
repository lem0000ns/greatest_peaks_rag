The Crouch family is a British wizarding family with ties to the Ministry of magic.
Notable members:
Cornelius Fudge
Mrs. Fudge
Rufus Fudge
While Cornelius Fudge was Minister for Magic, his nephew, Rufus Fudge, was given a job at the Ministry's Improper Use of Magic Office. One might suspect this to be a case of nepotism (DP2).
FudgeÂ (Engl) = to cheat or behave dishonestly; to fail to fulfil a promise or obligation.
