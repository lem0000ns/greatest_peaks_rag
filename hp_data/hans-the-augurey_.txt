"Just feed the bird some fairies and leave me alone."
-- an unnamed ICWQC official quoted in the Daily Prophet, 9 June 2014 (Pm)
The Liechtenstein National Quidditch team’s mascot is a huge Augurey named Hans who has his own fan club. High-spirited American fans at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup temporarily kidnapped Hans, which prompted the Liechtenstein manager Ferdinand Jägendorf to issue a statement saying ‘Das finden wir nicht lustig’ (‘we don’t find that funny’). After the President of the MACUSA got involved, Hans was returned (Pm).
Hans is described as "oversized" and "gloomy", and had accumulated a devoted fan base even before the tournament started (Liechtenstein's shock win over China bringing him to Quidditch fans' attention). Following his kidnap and return, Liechtenstein's Minister for Magic advocated the ejection of the USA from the tournament if it could be shown that any harm had come to their "beloved" mascot (Pm).
