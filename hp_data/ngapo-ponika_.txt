"Krum’s capture of the Snitch ahead of twenty-one-year-old Ngapo Ponika unquestionably showed traces of his old brilliance...."
-- Ginny Weasley report in the Daily Prophet, 20 May 2014 (Pm)
Ngapo Ponika played Seeker for New Zealand’s National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
During their first match at the Quidditch World Cup 2014 tournament where one of their Chasers had been sent off, Ponika failed to catch the Snitch before Bulgaria's Seeker Viktor Krum did, meaning New Zealand lost the match by 410 points to 170 (Pm).
As Ponika was twenty-one years old as of 20 May 2014, he is likely to have been born in 1992 (Pm).
Ngapo is a Maori given name. Ngapo Wehi, an exponent of traditional Māori performing arts, passed away in August 2016 (Maori Television).
Ponika is a Maori surname (pō "night", nikau "palm tree") (Maori Dictionary).
