"Nonsense, O'Flaherty"
-- Professor Binns to Seamus Finnegan (CS9)
O’Flaherty is a name by which Professor Binns addressed Seamus Finnegan during a classroom discussion in November of 1992.
"But, sir," said Seamus Finnigan, "if the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin's true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they?"
"Nonsense, O'Flaherty," said Professor Binns in an aggravated tone. "If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses haven't found the thing -" (CS9)
