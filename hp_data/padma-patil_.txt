Padma Patil is an identical twin of Parvati Patil.
Padma attended the Yule Ball in her fourth year (December 1994) with Ron Weasley, as a blind date arranged through her sister and Harry Potter(GF23), but it did not go well (GF24). Padma wore robes of bright turquoise (in the movie she wears pink and orange).
Padma was made a prefect in September 1995 (OP10), and joined Dumbledore’s Army in October of that year. It is not known whether her attendance at the first meeting of what became Dumbledore’s Army (OP16) was arranged through her sister Parvati, through Hermione Granger as a fellow prefect, through Ginny Weasley’s connections in Ravenclaw House, or some combination thereof.
During their sixth year, Padma and her sister Parvati were some of the students whose parents were so worried by Death Eater activity that they were almost called home.
Padma fought in the Battle of Hogwarts (DH29).
Dean Thomas considered her and her twin to be the best-looking girls in their year (GF23).
Siblings: Parvati Patil (twin)
