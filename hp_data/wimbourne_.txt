Wimbourne
Though Wimbourne does not exist in modern Britain, there is a Wimborne Minster – a small town near the Southern coast of England. This, then, is the probable home of the Wimbourne Wasps, a member of the British & Irish Quidditch League (QA7).
Wimborne Minster is on the River Stour in the county of Dorset. Although it is the likely home of the Wimbourne Wasps Quidditch team, the town's Wikipedia entry does not list any wizard sports or activities (Wikipedia).
