First Introduced Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (book)

During one particularly wet winter, Uric became convinced by the moaning of his Augureys that he had died and was now a ghost.
-- Newt Scamander in a footnote in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
Radolphus Pittiman was an author who wrote a biography of Uric the Oddball. Pittiman noted that Uric’s attempt to walk through walls, based on his believing that he had become a ghost, resulted in a ten-day long concussion (FB).
"Pittiman" could be read as "pity man," which could suggest his feelings toward the highly odd subject of his biography.
