Thundelarra Thunderers
The Thundelarra Thunderers are a Quidditch team from Australia (QA8).
The Thunderers, along with their traditional rivals the Woollongong Warriors, dominate the Australian league. Their competition is so fierce that refereeing a game between the two is seen as “asking for” personal injury, which has given rise to the response of “Yeah, and I think I’ll volunteer to ref the next Thunderer-Warrior game” when someone makes an unlikely statement (QA8).
Thundelarra, a sheep station in Western Australia, does not have any sports teams listed in Wikipedia - as it is far too small (Wikipedia).
