Franzinska Faust was the Quidditch team manager for the German National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
Her team’s participation in the 2014 Quidditch World Cup was cut short after an accident to their Seeker in their first match in the tournament against the Welsh National side. Faust reported that Pfeffer, a player who was injured after falling for a Wronski Feint performed by his Welsh counterpart, thought he was a budgie called “Klaus” when he came to, although he was likely in time to make a complete recovery (Pm).
Franziska is a German name, the feminine form of Francis, which comes from Latin Franciscus, meaning "Frenchman" (Behind the Name).
Faust comes from the Latin name Faustus, meaning "auspicious, lucky" (Behind the Name). Faust is also a character from German legend who sells his soul to the devil (Wikipedia).
