Priscilla Dupont was Minister for Magic from 1855 to 1858.
She began to despise the Muggle Prime Minister Lord Palmerston until he had "coins turning to frogspawn in his coat pockets" (Pm). Dupont was forced to resign from office, and Palmerston was unexplainably forced to resign just two days later.
