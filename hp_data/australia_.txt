Australia
Australia is both the smallest continent and its own country, located on a large island entirely in the southern hemisphere. Hermione sent her parents to Australia during the height of the war against Voldemort, to protect them from Death Eaters. She also modified their memories so they did not remember she existed (DH6). After Voldemortâ€™s final defeat she returned to retrieve them once more (BLC).
