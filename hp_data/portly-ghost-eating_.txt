First Introduced CS8: The Deathday Party

This stout ghost was almost eating at Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington‘s 500th Deathday party on Oct. 31, 1992.  Nick provided a long table of food  for his guests with rotten fish, burnt cakes, maggoty haggis, mouldy cheese and a cake in the shape of a tombstone. Harry watches as the portly ghost walks through the table and puts his mouth through the stinking salmon (CS8). In life, he was a wizard (OP38).
