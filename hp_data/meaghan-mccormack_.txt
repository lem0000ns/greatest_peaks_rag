First Introduced QA7: Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland

Meaghan McCormack is a Keeper for the Pride of Portree Quidditch team, around the 1990s.
Her mother, Catriona, was a famous Chaser and also Captain of the ‘Prides’ in the 1960s and her brother Kirley Duke is the lead guitarist of The Weird Sisters (QA7).
As her brother Kirley was born in 1971, after his mother had won the League with the Pride of Portree Quidditch team, Meaghan is likely to have been born within ten years either side of this date.
Meaghan is a variant of the Welsh name Megan, which is itself derived from the given name Margaret. This is derived from Latin margarita (Greek μαργαριτης, margarites), meaning "pearl", and may originally come from Sanskrit मञ्यरी (manyari) (Behind the Name).
McCormack is a Scottish surname, deriving from the pre-10th century Gaelic personal name Cormac. It has two possible meanings: corb (meaning "raven" or an earlier Celtic word "charioteer") plus mac "son of", therefore "son of the raven" or "son of the charioteer" (Internet Surname Database).
