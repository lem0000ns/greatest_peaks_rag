Inquisitorial Squad
The Inquisitorial Squad, Granger. A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, hand-picked by Professor Umbridge. Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial Squad do have the power to dock pointsâ€¦ so, Granger, I'll have five from you for being rude about our new Headmistress. Macmillan, five for contradicting me. Five because I don't like you, Potter. Weasley, your shirts untucked, so I'll have another five for that. Oh yeah, I forgot, you're a Mudblood, Granger, so ten off for that.

The Inquisitorial Squad was a group of students hand picked by Dolores Umbridge during her tenure as Headmistress for their support of the Ministry against Dumbledore (and specifically their willingness to support Umbridge). The members seemed to all be Slytherins (OP28).
They were given the authority to open and inspect packages, tell on people to Umbridge, and do other such dirty work for her. The members of the Inquisitorial Squad participated in the raid on the Dumbledore's Army (DA) meeting and captured a number of DA members, including Harry. Members of the Inquisitorial Squad were a small silver letter I on their robes. Although Prefects are not normally allowed to take points away from fellow prefects, members of the Inquisitorial Squad could and did.
Members:
After the Weasley twins left Hogwarts, the Inquisitorial Squad members were attacked in clever ways. Warrington developed a skin condition that made him look like he was covered in in cornflakes and Pansy Parkinson grew antlers (OP29).
