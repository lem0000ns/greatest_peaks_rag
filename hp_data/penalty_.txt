Penalty
"Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I've never seen such tactics."
-- Madam Hooch, refereeing the Slytherin v Gryffindor Quidditch Cup final (PA15)
A penalty is awarded to a team by the Referee when a foul is called in their favour (QA6).
Notes and interesting facts:
In sports, a 'penalty' (Eng) is a punishment or handicap (a kick or shot awarded to the opposing team) which is imposed on a player or team because of an infringement of the rules. (http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/penalty)
