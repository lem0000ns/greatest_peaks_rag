Profession Quidditch team manager and trainer
First Introduced QWC: The Quidditch World Cup (essays)

"I’m going to kill him."
-- interview with Hector Bolobolo, 14 May 2014 (QWC)
Hector Bolobolo was the Team Manager and Trainer for the Fiji National Quidditch team in 2014.
Following the disaster involving the Fijian team mascots during the Opening Ceremony at the  Quidditch World Cup tournament, Bolobolo’s team played one of the tournament favourites – Nigeria – in their first round match. After Fijian Seeker Joseph Snuka’s suicide-Snitch-grab cost Fiji the win, Bolobolo was extremely angry (QWC).
Hector means "holding fast" and comes from Greek ‘εκτωρ (hektor) and εχω (echo) meaning "to hold, to possess". Hector appears in Greek legends as one of the champions of Troy (Behind the Name).
Bolobolo is likely to come from the name of the rare Fijian Bolo snake (Ogmodon vitianus), although the word does mean "thicket" in the language of Madagascar and "duck" in Somali (Wiktionary).
