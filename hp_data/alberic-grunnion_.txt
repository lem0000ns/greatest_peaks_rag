Alberic Grunnion was the inventor of the Dungbomb (FW). His Chocolate Frog card was one of the ones Harry received on his first journey to Hogwarts (PS6).
Could possibly be in recognition of 'Alberich,' a powerful wizard from "Song of the Nibelungen." The poem is mythical, but was the basis for Wagner's Ring Cycle. In Wagner's version, Alberich makes a ring from gold that he has found and places a curse on it against its thief! Interestingly, one of the prizes given to a 'hero' of the Ring Cycle is an Invisibility Cloak. --Adrian Allum
