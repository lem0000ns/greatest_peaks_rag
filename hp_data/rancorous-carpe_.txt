Rancorous Carpe, who devised an elaborate trap, baited with an assortment of weapons he believed would be irresistible to Peeves, and a vast enchanted bell jar, reinforced by various Containment Charms, which he intended to drop over the poltergeist once he was in place. Not only did Peeves break easily through the giant bell jar, showering an entire corridor with broken glass, he also escaped the trap armed with several cutlasses, crossbows, a blunderbuss and a miniature cannon.

Rancorous Carpe was a Hogwarts caretaker (circa 1876) who made a spectacularly unsuccessful attempt to trap Peeves and rid the castle of him. He put out various weapons to lure the Poltergeist, and hoped to drop a “vast enchanted bell jar” on top of him and keep him there with Containment Charms. After a three-day standoff during which time the castle had to be evacuated, Carpe “took early retirement for health reasons.”
Peeves won this battle, because in order to get him to stop shooting a "blunderbuss and miniature cannon" at the teachers and students, Headmistress Eupraxia Mole had to promise him several things:
"rancorous" Eng. having bitterness or resentment
"carp" Eng. to criticize or find fault unnecessarily
"Carpe" may also be a pun on the Latin phrase "Carpe diem" or "seize the day" - Rancorous tried to "seize" Peeves but it turned into a shambles and he had to retire.
