QA9: The Development of the Racing Broom

 Type of Event Wizarding world 
The exciting newÂ Shooting Star broom was released by Universal Brooms in 1955. They were the cheapest racing broom on the market and very popular. Unfortunately, the brooms unfortunately developed problems over time (QA9).
Ron Weasley had a slow Shooting Star broom (CS4) and there were several (not very good ones) available for student use at Hogwarts (PA10, PA12).
