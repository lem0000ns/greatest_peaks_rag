Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland
The Quidditch teams of Britain and Ireland come from the Republic of Ireland and the four countries of the United Kingdom – comprised of England, Scotland and Wales (collectively “Great Britain”), and Northern Ireland. The broom game of Quidditch, originating in England and written about in the eleventh century, is popular with Witches and Wizards around the world.
The British and Irish Quidditch League was formed in 1674 when it became difficult to keep the many teams and their matches hidden from the Muggles. The thirteen best teams formed the League and the others were asked to disband. The League teams compete annually for the League Cup.
