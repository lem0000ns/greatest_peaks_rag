"....it is estimated that Beater Darren Floyd single-handedly prevented at least seventeen Brazilian goals."
-- match report Brazil v Wales, Daily Prophet, 4 June 2014 (Pm)
Darren Floyd was a Beater on the Welsh National Team at the Quidditch World Cup tournament in 2014.
During the 2014 tournament, the skills of the Welsh team were overshadowed and possibly distracted by the controversy surrounding their volatile manager, Gwenog Jones (Pm).
Winning their first match against Germany thanks to a failed dive by the German Seeker, Wales were eliminated from the tournament in the quarter-finals after losing to Brazil by 460 points to 300. He and the other Welsh Beater, Iefan Rice, had to restrain Gwenog after the defeat (Pm).
Like all Beaters, a bit ruthless and crazy
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Floyd must have been born after 1976.
The Welsh name Darren may come from y darren (tarren = "escarpment, edge") or may be related to an Irish Gaelic name meaning "a great man, gift of God" (Quick Baby Names).
Floyd is a variant of the Welsh surname Lloyd, deriving from the word llwyd (meaning "grey, hoary" or possibly someone who wore "grey clothing"). The "f" is probably comes from an attempt by an English speaker to pronounce the Welsh letter "ll" (Internet Surname Database).
