Profession Examiner
First Introduced OP31: O.W.L.s

The O.W.L. Care of Magical Creatures examiner who examines Harry is a “plump little witch”, and seems to be less stern than some of the others as she smiles at Harry when the exam is over (OP31).
The students are tested on Knarls, Fire Crabs, unicorns and Bowtruckles (OP31).
