Profession Campaigner for the suppression of trolls
First Introduced DP2: Daily Prophet Issue 2

"Artemius Lawson .... blasted the Troll Rights Movement as 'irresponsible' and 'out of control'"
-- report of Mr Lawson's speech in the Daily Prophet (DP2)
Artemius Lawson was an outspoken notorious campaigner for the suppression of trolls (DP2).
Lawson objects to letting them wander free, referring to trolls as creatures who "weigh a ton and have brains the size of a bogey". He has a point (DP2).
Artemius is the Latin form of the Greek name Αρτεμιος (Artemios), which derives from the goddess of the moon and the hunt, Artemis (αρτεμης (artemes) "safe" or αρταμος (artamos) "a butcher") (Behind the Name).
Lawson is an ancient surname of unknown origin and may be a nickname deriving from the name Lawrence (Internet Surname Database); "Law-son" suggests the character's law-and-order attitude toward trolls.
While the date printed on DP2 is 8 February 1999, the timeframe for these events is 1992-1993.
