Bring Back Our Baskets! is an article about Quidditch published in the Daily Prophet on 12 February 1883, recording the unhappiness of the fans who preferred baskets (which were unregulated as to size) to the new standardised goal hoops brought in by the Department of Magical Games and Sports (QA6).
