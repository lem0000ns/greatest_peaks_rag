Fawcett family


					Fawcett family
			
First Introduced GF6: The Portkey

A wizarding family from Ottery St. Catchpole (GF6).
Notable members of the Fawcett family:
Miss S. Fawcett
Miss Fawcett is first mentioned in CS. Plumbing is important in that book, so "Fawcett" may be a purposeful play on "faucet" - perhaps foreshadowing the discovery of the snake carved into the sink in CS16.
The name of this family is borrowed from a friend of Rowling's, Professor Tonks Fawcett of the University of Edinburgh.
