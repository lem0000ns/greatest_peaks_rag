Thornton Harkaway was President of the Magical Congress of the United States (MACUSA) when it was located in Williamsburg, Virginia (Pm:MACUSA).
President Harkaway raised Crups, a type of magical Jack Russell terrier with a split tail that are quite protective of their owners. Unfortunately, Harkaway's pack of Crups attacked and wounded several non-magical residents of Williamsburg, leading to a breach of the International Statute of Secrecy. President Harkaway was forced out of office, and Williamsburg became the first city in the United States to have a psychiatric hospital for any No-Majs who "saw things" during that time (Pm:MACUSA).
Leadership skills as President, as well as being an animal lover, but could not control his pack of vicious Crups.
