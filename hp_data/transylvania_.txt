Transylvania
Though once a sovereign nation in its own right, Transylvania became part of Romania after World War I and has remained so ever since. It is of course also known for being the setting of  Bram Stokerâ€™s Dracula, giving it a stereotyped association with vampires and bats. As a result, Terrortours advertises in the Daily Prophet that they rent out castles here.
The Quidditch team from Transylvania played Flanders in the first ever Quidditch World Cup final in 1473, a match famous for a wide array of fouls that included the Transylvanian captain releasing a hundred blood-sucking vampire bats onto the field (QA8); over five hundred years later the national team flattened England in a slightly more fairly contested match (GF5).
As of Christmas 1994, Transylvania was to sign an International Ban on Duelling (GF23).
