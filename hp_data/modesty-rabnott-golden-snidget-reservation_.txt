Modesty Rabnott Snidget Reservation
The Modesty Rabnott Snidget Reservation was established in the fourteenth century in Somerset to protect a dwindling population of Golden Snidgets. Dwindling because they were being hunted for sport as well as killed in Quidditch matches, the Chieftainess of the Wizards’ Council, Elfrida Clagg, made the Snidget a protected species. The Reservation was named for Modesty Rabnott, who famously saved a Snidget from a Quidditch match in 1269 (QA4).
