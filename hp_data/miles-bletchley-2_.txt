"....the goalposts are ahead – come on, now, Angelina – Keeper Bletchley dives – misses – GRYFFINDOR SCORE!"
-- Lee Jordan (PS11)
Miles Bletchley was a Hogwarts student in Slytherin House c.1989-1996. He was on the Slytherin Quidditch Team, playing as their Keeper, during Harry Potter’s first Quidditch match in 1991 (PS11).
Bletchley hit Alicia Spinnet from behind with a jinx in the library prior to the autumn 1995 Gryffindor-Slytherin match, but Professor Snape refused to believe the fourteen eye-witnesses. During the match, Bletchley saved one goal try by Angelina Johnson but let through another, before a Snitch catch by Harry won the match (OP19).
Miles is derived from the German name Milo, which is of uncertain meaning. It is also associated with the Latin word miles, meaning "soldier" (Behind the Name).
Bletchley is a town near Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire. Bletchley Park, where British and Allied Force codebreakers worked during World War II, is open to the public. There is also a Shropshire village called Bletchley (Wikipedia).
Since Bletchley was at least a second year when Harry started at Hogwarts (given the ban on first years being on a Quidditch team), and since he was still at Hogwarts in the 1995-96 school year (when he jinxed Alicia), he must be either one year - or more likely two years - older than Harry.
He may also be related to the Bletchley whose office was "raining" at the Ministry of Magic (DH13).
