Famous Wizard Cards: Analysis and Discussion

By ibid •
December 29, 2016


In the book, these cards are collected and traded by students and referred to as Chocolate Frog Cards. However, “real” versions of these cards exist, created by Rowling herself, providing a fascinating look into the vast scope of Wizarding history.
After the release of the fourth book, the world of Harry Potter expanded quite dramatically. Rowling sold the film rights of the series to Warner Bros. and also signed merchandising contracts with a number of companies. In order for some of these products to be made, additional information about the Harry Potter universe was required. Rather than let others create this information, Rowling did it herself. The 101 famous wizard cards are one of the results of that effort. Later cards were written for other mediums. This list attempts to compare all of the different cards written. It is unclear if all of these sources are from J. K. Rowling. I have tried to keep my commentary to a minimum and let the text stand on its own.
These cards were conclusively written by Rowling in some form or another. They constituted the card set for the Electronic Arts Chamber of Secrets video game, and some of the Philosopher Stone video games as well (others only had small parts of this set). Most (if not all) of these cards were included in the Prisoner of Azkaban game. Some cards later wound up on Rowling’s website and Pottermore. Different platforms had slightly different versions of the text. The only platform that I could personally verify (based on a YouTube video) is the PC version of Chamber of Secrets, which is here labeled as CS/g. The abridged Americanized copies of the cards included in the March 2003 issue of the Disney Adventures magazine is labeled Dis. Other (unverified) versions are labeled EA. I believe that the version later carried over to Pottermore is the most accurate version, but that is probably up to interpretation. When comparing the different unverified versions, I choose to ignore any differences easily attributed to typos unless they affect canon in some way.
The EA game for the Prisoner of Azkaban introduced twenty-five supplementary cards in addition to the original 101. I somewhat doubt the validity of many of these cards (due to them being rehashes of either old Harry Potter material or of real-life/mythological figures with no new Harry Potter content.) Twelve of these cards I do not consider to be canon (more detail below). The non-canon cards are still shown.
The candy chocolate frogs included collectible cards. Different editions of these were made by different companies throughout the years. In the early 2000’s a set of twenty-four cards in the style of real chocolate frog cards was released in the US by Hasbro. Although all of these characters had previously appeared in the EA cards, these entries were greatly expanded. I have yet to see any concrete evidence that they were written by Rowling, but they definitely have a similar writing style. They are included here under the label Hasbro.
Universal Studios made some cards to accompany the movie replica chocolate frogs which they sold in their parks. A total of five cards were made – the founders and Dumbledore. The text was mainly that of JKR, but a few lines were added. Rowling most probably didn’t write the additions as they are just rehashing existing canon. Nevertheless, they are included here (under the label WWHP) for completeness, as they match the format.
Although there have been many other incarnations of these candies, none have included cards which either match this format or which have reasonable possibility of being written by Jo.
In 2004, JK Rowling’s old website started a feature where each month a different Wizard or Which would be feature with a small blurb. At first these were just repostings of the EA cards, but later some new characters would be featured as well. By the time that this stopped (41 wizards later) in 2007, nineteen new bios had been featured, twelve of which were brand new characters never shown on cards before.
Ten chocolate frog cards are mentioned by name (Agrippa, Circe, Cliodna, Alberic Grunnion, Hengist of Woodcroft, Paracelsus, Ptolemy, Merlin, Morgana, and Dumbledore), though the only one which we are given any indication of the contents is Dumbledore. In a later writing on McGonagall, Rowling went on to reveal that she also got her own card, but never gave us the contents.
In June of 2015, the old Pottermore included a “Timeline of the Wizarding World” (also known as “History of Magic”). This was really just a version of the EA cards compiled with JKR (JKR was used over EA for the seven entries which conflicted.) arranged in chronological order by birthdate. In addition, two incorrect dates (Beatrix Bloxam and Albus Dumbledore) were fixed, “The Weird Sisters” became “the Weird Sisters”, “Warlock’s Council” became “Wizards’ Council”, “potion making” became “potion-making”, and the Miranda Goshawk card was excluded (probably due to inconsistency with the new Book of Spells). While some may view this as non-canon due to its lack of new info, I personally view this as the highest form of canon here for determining the order of the medieval wizards, and for conflicts between different editions of the cards. It should be noted that Pottermore used the red quill icon (which they use to indicate things written by Jo) next to every entry in this timeline.
The old Pottermore had collectible wizard cards that you could pick up. These were usually either a direct copy of EA or a paraphrased version. Occasionally they rehashed info from other canon sources as well. These covered sixty of the 101 original cards. There is absolutely no new info here, and these descriptions clearly weren’t newly written by Rowling. They are only included here for sake of completeness.
Harry Potter Lexicon’s old master card list (https://legacy.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/card_wizards.html)
This list was a compilation of Dis, Hasbro, and info from the books. PA/g is appended to the bottom. Although definitely canon, the list itself is clearly not a primary source.
Harry Potter Wiki’s card list (http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Chocolate_Frog_Cards)
This list is a mixture of the Lexicons list, some primary sources, some clearly non-canon sources, and people’s imagination. (Like most of the wiki.) Case in point, see Harry’s entry. As such, this list obviously is not to be relied upon.
Most other lists online take one or both of the previous two lists as gospel.
Harry Potter Trading Card Game
While I would have loved to include stuff from here, there wasn’t much that I could. The only “new” information comes from the card titles, and the characters in the trading card game are exclusively contemporary characters. (The only overlap is Harry and Dumbledore.) I’m not making entries for Quirrell and Sprout just to show off their (possibly canonical) first names.
The Jelly Belly cards
In 2011, Jelly Belly took over the distribution of the candy chocolate frogs, and made a set of sixteen cards, in the style of famous wizard cards. However, these are clearly just rehashings of book information. Additionally, the only overlap is Dumbledore (copy paste of the books description) and a few of the Weird Sisters (EA but without the words “Weird Sisters”). There was no point of including just those five cards, and no point of creating new entries for non-canonical cards. Most of the other incarnations of these candies had cards without accompanying text, or only had cards of place and animals.
From JKR’s old website’s FAQ:
Q. Did you actually write the information that ended up on the Famous Wizard cards? For that matter, what about the spells in the films? Did you invent those or did Steve Kloves? And why were new incantations created for the movie in the first place? (Example: “Incendio” to “Lacarnum Inflamari”.) (A Mugglenet/Lexicon question)
A. Yes, I wrote the information on the original Famous Wizard cards. As you have noticed, a few of them have now popped up on the ‘Wizard of the Month’ cards on my website desk.
Spells in the films – there I’ve lost track. Steve invented some and I gave him others. Some of the new incantations, such as ‘lacarnum inflamari’ must have sounded more dramatic onscreen – although by the time you’ve managed to say ‘lacarnum inflamari’, you’ve surely lost precious seconds in which the Devil’s Snare might have throttled you. But that’s showbiz.
From Warner Bros. vs RDR Books:
Plaintiff: What are wizard cards?
Rowling: Within the world of Harry Potter, if you buy a chocolate frog, then you receive a famous wizard card inside the wrapping.
Plaintiff: Did you create wizard cards for use in an Electronic Arts video game?
Rowling: Yes, I did.
Plaintiff: And do Warner Bros. and Electronic Arts own the copyright to those cards?
Rowling: Yes, I believe so.
Plaintiff: Let’s put on the screen Exhibit 34. Can you please tell the Court what Exhibit 34 is.
Rowling: This is a list of the famous wizards, well, fictional famous wizards, and their achievements and dates of life and death — of birth and death, that I provided to Electronic Arts.
Plaintiff: Did you make these wizards up?
Rowling: I did. Occasionally there is someone who existed in reality. I’ve taken some liberties with their biography.
This is a matter of some debate, as I am told that there is circumstantial evidence that these cards were all written by Rowling. I will therefore lay out the reasons why I do not consider lots of them to be canon. Note that I still include them, just in italics text, somewhat distinct from the rest.
I will start off by saying that all of the “reprints” of the cards ignored the PA/g cards. (Hasbro took 24 of the CS/g cards, JKR took 29, PmTrunk took 59, and Pm took all of CS/g and JKR.) Going with my general approach that the Pottermore timeline is the most accurate edition, the absence of PA/g very significant. Also, unlike some of the other sources (CS/g and JKR), we do not have any confirmation that these came from Rowling.
Looking at the twenty-five cards themselves, we have some that clearly look like canon, while others that clearly don’t.
Twelve of these cards contain no new creative work. (Eight are real-life mythological figures without any signs of adaptation, and four are preexisting Harry Potter characters.)
A more telling example of this is Professor Dippet’s card:
Professor Armando Dippet
Former Headmaster of Hogwarts, c. 1940.
This lack of new information, using a vague date based solely after his appearance in the books, is usually indicative of someone other than Rowling compiling what we already know, not writing new canon.
The twelve cards in this category are:
Already existing characters: Professor Armando Dippet (books), Barberus Bragge (QttA), Edgar Cloggs (Video Games), Hengist of Upper Barnton (FW)
Characters clearly directly based off of real-life or mythological figures WITHOUT any Harry Potter connection: Dzou Yen, Count Vlad Drakul, Babayaga, Old Mother Hubbard, Bran the Bloodthirsty, Cyclops, Goliath, Morholt
Another five cards, while also showing distinct signs of being based on real-life/mythological figures, have been somewhat adapted (three of which were made to match the Harry Potter world.)
Adapted, just not for Harry Potter: Amarillo Lestoat, Lady Carmilla Sanguina
Adapted to fit Harry Potter: Sir Herbert Varney, Malodora Grymm, Leticia Somnolens
Then we have the eight completely new characters.
Three of these reappeared in later canon: Ug the Unreliable, Urg the Unclean, Gringott
Two of them reference Fantastic Beasts: Cordelia Misericordia Eargit the Ugly
Three other new characters: Falco Aesalon, Blodwyn Bludd, Alguff the Awful
I would put these cards as less canonical then the original 101, but once again, it’s really up for interpretation, and I include them all for the sake of completeness. (The twelve cards which don’t look like canon are in smaller text.)
Note that I am excluding the cards which just feature creatures (Common Welsh Green Dragon, Hebridean Black Dragon, Hungarian Horntail Dragon, Romanian Longhorn Dragon, Norwegian Ridgeback Dragon, Imp, Doxy, Bowtruckle, Billywig, Gnome, Giant Squid, Manticore, Unicorn, Mountain Troll, Phoenix), because A)They are beasts, not beings, and B)The contents of the cards are just rehashing of information form Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (with the possible exception of “Doxy” and “Giant Squid”):
