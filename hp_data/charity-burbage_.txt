"I, for one, don’t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned"
-- Arthur Weasley (DH6)
Charity Burbage was a professor of Muggle Studies at Hogwarts (DH2). She wrote an impassioned defense of Muggle-borns in the Daily Prophet during the summer of 1997; in retaliation, she was taken prisoner, then killed personally by Voldemort less than a week later at Malfoy Manor, at which point he offered her body to Nagini as a meal (DH1). The Daily Prophet did not report her disappearance or death, but reported shortly after Harry’s return to Privet Drive for that summer that Professor Burbage had resigned her job (DH2).
In Christianity, charity is a virtue involving love for one's neighbors as one loves God and oneself (source: Wikipedia).
Burbage may be a reference to Richard Burbage, who is chiefly known for his roles in Shakespeare's tragedies (source: Wikipedia). Burbage is also the name of a civil parish in Leicestershire, England (source: Wikipedia).
