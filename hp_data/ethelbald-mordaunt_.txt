"As a law-abiding member of the magical community who does not pretend to be a great wit, I have often wondered why my fellow wizards feel the need to perform spells and charms in the name of 'fun'."
-- Ethelbald Mordaunt, letter to the Daily Prophet (DP1)
Wizard whose next door neighbour, Elladora Guffy, was overly fond of practical joke spells (DP1)
