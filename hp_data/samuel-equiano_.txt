-- match report Japan v Nigeria, Daily Prophet, 10 June 2014 (Pm)
Samuel Equiano played Seeker for the Nigerian National Team at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.
During their first match at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup, Fijian Seeker Joseph Snuka made an early catch of the Snitch, ending the match and allowing the Nigerian team to win by 400 points to 160 (Pm).
Tournament favourites Nigeria then lost their quarter-final match against Japan by 270 points to 100 after Equiano's Thunderbolt VII broom was destroyed by a Bludger hit by one of the Japanese Beaters (Pm).
Since Viktor Krum, born 1976, was the oldest player at the tournament (Pm), Equiano must have been born after 1976.
Samuel is a Hebrew name meaning "heard or asked of God" (Quick Baby Names: Samuel).
The surname Equiano occurs in The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The African, an autobiographical book recounting the life of an African slave who eventually became a businessman in Great Britain. He was born in Benin around 1745, in an area that is now part of Nigeria (Wikipedia: Olaudah Equiano).
