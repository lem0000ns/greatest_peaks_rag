First Introduced PA15: The Quidditch Final

Bole was a Beater on the Slytherin Quidditch team in the 1990s. He deliberately fouled Alicia Spinnet in the 1994 Gryffindor-Slytherin Quidditch final by hitting her with his club. Bole then claimed he had thought she was a Bludger (PA15).
Then again, given the usual standard of Slytherin Beater brainpower, maybe it really was an accident….
A bole is the trunk of a tree, an apt name given the build of a typical Slytherin Beater.
As Bole's last year at Hogwarts was the 1994-95 school year, when Quidditch games had been cancelled for the Triwizard Tournament (OP19), he is likely to have been born during 1977.
