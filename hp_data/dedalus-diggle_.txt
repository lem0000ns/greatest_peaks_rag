First Introduced PS5: Diagon Alley

Dedalus Diggle was a member of the Order of the Phoenix in both the first and second wars against Voldemort (OP3, OP9). He also happened to be in the Leaky Cauldron when Hagrid brought Harry in on July 31, 1991. Diggle once bowed to Harry in a shop (PS5), much to Petunia Dursley’s horror. He lived in Kent and, according to Minerva McGonagall, never had any sense (PS1). Diggle served as an escort for Vernon, Petunia, and Dudley Dursley, getting them to safety when the enchantment of Harry’s protection was broken. While he was taking care of the Dursleys, his house was searched by Death Eaters and burned down (DH11).
Daedalus (Greek mythology) - the legendary inventor who designed the labyrinth to imprison the Minotaur. When Minos later imprisoned him on Crete, Daedalus created wings out of wax and feathers so that he and his son Icarus could fly to safety; Icarus flew too near the sun and fell to his death when the wax melted, but Daedalus escaped. - MLW
