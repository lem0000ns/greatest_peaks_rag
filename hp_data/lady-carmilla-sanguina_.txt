Lady Carmilla Sanguina


					Lady Carmilla Sanguina
			
Gender Female Birth 1561
Death 1757
Species / Race Vampire
First Introduced FW: The Famous Wizard Cards

Lady Carmilla Sanguina was a vampire who used her victims’ blood for bathing, in the hopes that it would help her stay young and beautiful (FW).
Carmilla is an alias used by Mircalla, Countess Karnstein, the vampire in Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu's Gothic novella Carmilla.
Sanguina = Latin, sanguineus "of blood," also "bloody, bloodthirsty."
196 years is a long time to live - even for witches and wizards. Vampires are generally understood to be functionally immortal, so it might be inferred that Lady Carmilla Sanguina's time as a vampire counts as part of her life and that her death occurs when her vampire self is destroyed. -BB
Likely inspired by Elizabeth Bathory (AKA "The Blood Countess"), a sadistic noblewoman and serial killer of young women who allegedly bathed in the blood of her victims in order to remain young (source: Wikipedia). -BB
