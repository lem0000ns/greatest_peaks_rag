Ragnuk the First was a goblin king and one of the goblins who made the Sword of Gryffindor (DH25).Â After delivering the sword to Gryffindor, Ragnuk conspired to steal it back.
Ragnuk spread the lie that Gryffindor had stolen the sword and sent goblins to steal it back. However, Gryffindor used his wand to defend himself and sent the minions back to their king with a dire warning of what would happen if he tried to steal the sword again (Pm).
