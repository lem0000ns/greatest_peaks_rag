First Introduced GF30: The Pensieve

Alice Longbottom, along with her husband Frank, were Aurors, popular in the Wizarding World, who fought valiantly against Voldemort and his supporters during the 1970s. Frank and Alice were captured by Death Eaters shortly after the fall of Voldemort (late 1981). They were subjected to the Cruciatus Curse in an attempt to force them to tell where the defeated Dark Lord had fled to. The torture drove them insane and are now at St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries in Ward 49.
She has a round face; her son Neville looks a lot like her, though by the mid-1990s her hair is wispy and gray. She does realize that Neville is someone she likes and gives him Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum wrappers for gifts. Gran, Frank’s mother, thinks of them as rubbish, but we get the feeling that Neville would save every single one if he could (OP23).
