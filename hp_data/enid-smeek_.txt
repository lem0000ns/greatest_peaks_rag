Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now dimmed. “The fire’s lit, but the cauldron’s empty," as Ivor Dillons put it to me, or, in Enid Smeek’s slightly earthier phrase, “She’s nutty as squirrel poo.”
—excerpt from The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter (DH18)
Enid Smeek was a woman who knew or knew of Bathilda Bagshot and described her to Rita Skeeter as “nutty as squirrel poo” (DH18).
