Albert Runcorn was a tall, bearded wizard who works for the Ministry of Magic.

Runcorn = the name of a town in Cheshire, England, of which the earliest mention is in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, where it is spelled "Rumcofan", literally meaning "a wide cove or bay". Derived from the Old English words "rúm" ("wide") and "cofa" ("cave" or "cove").
Albert Runcorn is played by David O'Hara in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 (IMDb).
