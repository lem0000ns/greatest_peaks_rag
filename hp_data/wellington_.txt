Wellington
Wellington is the capital of New Zealand, as well as the seat of the New Zealand Ministry of Magic. Quidditch here dates back to the seventeenth century, and as a result there is Maori art from the period depicting white wizards on brooms. Those pieces of art the Ministry has obtained are on display in its headquarters in Wellington (QA8).
