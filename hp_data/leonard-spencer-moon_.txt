Note the similarities of the name Leonard Spencer-Moon with his counterpart in the Muggle World, Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill. Is J.K. Rowling hinting that they are somehow related through the Spencer family, which later gave us Lady Diana Spencer, Princess of Wales, and mother of Prince William and Prince Harry?
