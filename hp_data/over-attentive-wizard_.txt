					Over-Attentive Wizard
			
Gender Male Species / Race Wizard
First Introduced CC1: Cursed Child Act 1

A man on Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters who was particularly interested in Harry and got him to autograph something (CC1.4).
Trying to forge his own identity, Albus Potter is bothered by people like this wizard who fawn over Harry (CC1.4).
"OVER-ATTENTIVE WIZARD" is merely how the CC stage directions refer to this otherwise unidentified man.Â Note, however, that no one actually calls him this.
