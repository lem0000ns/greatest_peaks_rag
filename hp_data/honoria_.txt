First Introduced WHH: The Warlock’s Hairy Heart

Honoria was the aunt of Albus Dumbledore.  He referred to her as his “maiden aunt.”  She was engaged to a wizard once, but broke the engagement because “he had a hairy heart,” according to her.  However, rumors said she had found her fiance fondling Horklumps, and was deeply shocked by it.
It is unknown whether Honoria is Kendra's sister or Percival's.  Even though Kendra is a Muggle-born, there is precedent for Muggle-born siblings both having magic (like the Creeveys).
