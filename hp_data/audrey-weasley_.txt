First Introduced WFam – Weasley Family Tree

Audrey Weasley is the wife of Percy Weasley (YL).
Spouse: Percy Weasley
Children: Molly Weasley (II), and Lucy Weasley
The character Audrey in William Shakespeare's As You Like It marries Touchstone, although she never really understands what he's talking about. Percy likes to orate about complicated things to make himself sound important; perhaps his wife's name suggests that she doesn't put a great deal of mental energy towards actually engaging with her husband's discourses. (This speculation is tenuous, however, since Percy and Touchstone are such very different characters.)
