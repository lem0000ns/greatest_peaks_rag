Nugent Potts was a professional Quidditch referee in the 1890s. Potts was shot through the nose by a stray arrow let off by a celebrating Appleby Arrows fan during a match in 1894. This practice (which took place every time their Chasers scored) was then banned by the Department of Magical Games and Sports (QA7).
Nugent is usually a surname deriving from the placename Nogent which is found in Northern France. It comes from Latin novientum ("new settlement") (Internet Surname Database).
The surname Potts may come from the given name Philpott (Greek Philippos "to love horses") or Old English pot ("living by a hole or pit") (Internet Surname Database).
