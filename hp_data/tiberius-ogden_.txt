Tiberius Ogden was a Wizengamot elder who (along with Griselda Marchbanks) resigned in protest when Fudge appointed Dolores Umbridge as the first Hogwarts High Inquisitor (OP15). Ogden was a friend of Professor Tofty of the Wizarding Examinations Authority (OP31).
Possibly related to Bob Ogden or whomever is behind Ogden's Firewhiskey. -BB
It is possible that Cormac McLaggen's 'Uncle Tiberius' (a favorite of Horace Slughorn) is Tiberius Ogden, especially since both hold a high office in the Ministry of Magic (HBP7).
