First Introduced OP30: Grawp

"Well, I mean, I’d already let in that one of Davies’s, so I wasn’t feeling all that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came towards me, just out of nowhere, I thought – you can do this! And I had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop – my right, obviously, his left – but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the chance and flew left – his right, I mean – and – well – you saw what happened...."
-- Ron Weasley on saving Bradley's goal (OP30)
Bradley was a Hogwarts student in Ravenclaw House in the 1990s and was a Chaser on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.
Bradley played in the match against Gryffindor for the Quidditch Cup towards the end of the 1995-96 school year. Ron Weasley saved Bradley’s attempts on goal, and Gryffindor won the match (OP30, OP31).
Bradley is an early medieval Anglo-Scottish surname, meaning "a broad clearing" (Internet Surname Database).
